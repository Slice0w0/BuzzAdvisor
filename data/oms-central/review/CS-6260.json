                        "body": "It's a good class for covering the foundations of cryptography, it helps build intuition about insecurity and misuse of existing tools without going into the full blown implementation details of such tools (for the most part). Which is fine, given that most likely you will just be using an existing cryptographic library most of the time in your job or elsewhere.\n\nThere are 6 homeworks. 4 do not have any programming involved, 1 is only programming based, and the last one has a small programming section. For the most part you will be writing hypothetical attacks/proofs, analyzing the insecurity of proposed schemes (again, the goal is to build intuition). You can work in groups, but I chose to work alone because I didn't want to rely on others due to my changing timezones and found it very manageable (I got around 80% on the HWs putting around 1 day's worth of effort into writing them out/thinking about them).\n\nThere are 2 exams, challenging but fair for the most part. Open book. They will pretty much determine whether you get a B or A. The curve is quite generous (B is 60%+).\n\nThe quizzes are the most frustrating part of the course. You start second guessing yourself after falling for a few gotchas. That said, their weighting isn't that heavy so it'll probably piss you off more than it should.\n\nI fell off short of an A by 0.2%, but nevertheless I still recommend it. I paired with GIOS and the deadlines turned out to be quite complimentary and manageable. If you're the kind of person who enjoys brainteasers and that sort of thing, you will enjoy the class. I think the importance of understanding proofs themselves is overblown, it's more about building intuition.",

They are similar, but not quite in the ways you expect. It\u2019s more that the vast majority of the workload is personal study time. \n\n(My background). I did a math minor and EE in undergrad. This is my 13th or 14th class and I think the most relevant ones to prepare were GA and IHPC (mainly for runtime analysis and writing pseudocode), some of the machine learning classes (for reading math notation), and IIS (for understanding modular math and RSA beforehand). In the past I also worked on a personal project that heavily involved encryption, which was a key motivation for me to take this class. All this is to say my experience will not be representative for you if you haven\u2019t studied the topics before.\n\n(Learning objectives). I want to counter the previous two reviews, which I think have no idea what this class is about. It\u2019s common wisdom to nEvEr WrItE yOuR oWn EnCrYpTiOn LiBrArIeS, but what I found with my personal project is that all the \u201creputable\u201d cryptographic libraries in both Java and Python are hot garbage written in such a way to blame you the user for \"using them wrong\" when you inevitably get hacked. I haven\u2019t looked at other languages yet, but I assume they\u2019re the same. You need to take a class like this one to understand how to use the libraries. Which options are the current best practices, and which are terrible but kept around for compatibility? Which options are more future-proof? How much efficiency are you giving up achieving a particular level of security? What constraints and gotchas do each method have? In which situations are various methods secure or insecure? What are the different definitions and levels of \u201csecurity\u201d? This is a math/pseudocode heavy class because it\u2019s supposed to make you better at reading the documentation of cryptographic libraries, rather than a better coder. \n\n(Difficulty). I haven\u2019t taken the final yet, but my current grade is such that I\u2019ll need a 70% on it to keep an A, or 12.5% for a B. There are 12 quizzes (18%), 6 homework (20%), a midterm (27%), and a final (35%). Your lowest quiz and homework are both dropped. The quizzes are proctored and closed-everything. When I took them, it felt like there were lots of frustrating gotcha questions. After reviewing them before exams, they seem more obvious, and I now think they\u2019re mostly fair. They are worded way differently from the lectures/books so that you must sit and reason them out carefully, and you\u2019re still probably going to miss 1 question on average every single week. The homework are less frustrating, but like for GA class you need a \u201ceureka\u201d moment to avoid getting docked most of the points. The exams are like the quizzes and homework, but open notes (still closed internet) so hopefully you\u2019ll do slightly better unless you succumb to the time pressure. \n\n(Tips to succeed). For the quizzes, I found that watching the lectures at 1.5x-2.0x speed and then reading the relevant sections of George\u2019s notes was the best time/value and was good enough to get most of the points on quizzes. Sit and reason through the questions, because they are worded to break your ability to pattern-match from the lessons. For homework you\u2019ll spend a lot of time doing CTRL+F through the allowed textbooks, most of which are massive. Not much more to say other than hopefully you find the \u201ceureka\u201d moment quickly. The exams are open notes, so the best way to prepare is to put together good notes. Take screenshots of the office hours to get the solutions for all the homework and quizzes and practice exams, write out a table of each encryption/signing method and what definitions of security they meet or don\u2019t meet, write out factoids you think are important based on where you struggled with the quizzes/homework, look at your homework feedback in gradescope to get a sense of the rubric. You are provided links to lecture slides and textbooks during the exam, but you should organize what you need beforehand to save time during the honorlock session.\n\n(Overall thoughts). A much lower workload than I expected, due to the emphasis on knowing what factors lead to what levels/types of security, as opposed to knowing the innards of any practical algorithms. They do not let you work ahead, so I was forced to relax and forget about class for a few days each week. There\u2019s a lot of prerequisite knowledge for reading math notation, analyzing the runtime and correctness of algorithms, and understanding what makes a good mathematical proof. If you don\u2019t have those, that\u2019s where you\u2019ll get stuck spending extra time.\n",

                        "body": "To start, some general perspective on classes with curves. Bottom line is to not rely on them to achieve the marks you want. Many people dropped the class in my cohort because they thought they would not meet their goals. Realize that this class has a curve for a reason and ultimately it is up to the professor's discretion how the curve is applied, which often goes in the student's favor.\n\nThis is a tough class. Though, it is not just a lot about how cryptography works. I found that I also learned more about an attacker's perspective and the resilience needed to exploit vulnerabilities. Within the context of this class, it means proving under certain security definitions whether a given scheme is secure or not. What makes this class difficult is the theory and discrete math needed to address the various proofs in the assignments and exams. If you're like me, you probably do not do this in your regular work environment, and haven't touched discrete math for several years. I highly recommend reviewing how cryptographic security proofs work prior to this course.\n\nThe TAs are great and the professor is very knowledgeable. The lectures and crypto-notes were the most helpful for me. Really understand the practice problems given prior to the exams as there aren't a lot of outside resources to get other practice. If you are a diligent student, you will do fine. This is not a course you can half pay attention to while you work full-time. I wouldn't recommend pairing this with another class or taking it outside of the info sec track unless you are truly interested in learning about cryptography.",

                        "body": "I'm putting in this review a year after I took this class because I am in GA now and Applied Cryptography is the ONLY class that prepared me for GA (for reference, I'm in OMSCS - ML track). Not in content (except for the RSA unit), but in the structure of the course and the \"proof\" nature of the problems, and the fact that you just need to memorize some methods and be able to apply them to future situations. That is invaluable in GA right now. So definitely take this class! Put in the work and by the time you get to GA, you will be glad you did!",

                        "body": "Note the 12 (maybe even 15 but no more) hours per week is averaged throughout the whole semester, I tended to put more hours in the weeks a homework was due and fewer hours the following week. The weekly quizzes make it difficult to let up though, which is probably a good thing since it forces you to keep up as the semester progresses. This is my 11th class (post-grad elective) and I got by every other class mostly watching lectures passively and starting on assignments casually. This is the first time I watched every video and took diligent notes AND read the course text, you need to be prepared. FWIW I found the B&R text to be a pleasant (almost enjoyable) read. Recommend! I also had to start assignments the day they were assigned to let the problems marinate. \n\nThis class was explained to me before I took it as the OMSCyber version of CS6515 Graduate Algorithms (\"GA\") but I find that comparison very superficial. Many students report difficulty in both due to being math, concept, proof, etc heavy classes but the BIG distinguishing factor that makes GA easier IMO is the large body of practice problems (e.g., leetcode). You can grind your way to understanding and put in the repetition and work for GA. In AC there is no major pool of practice problems and many times I would read and study the material to think I get it and have 1-2 problems from the HW to test my understanding then only to get the midterm / final to see that I, in fact, did not. This was the only frustrating part of the whole course but then again my learning style leans more towards this practice, drilling, and repetition.\n\nI found that the cadence of the course is well thought out and there were nice breaks for the fall semester. For example, you finish symmetric encryption with the midterm right before Thanksgiving and then you get the week after truly off. You get some time to know your course standing right before the drop date.\n\nI attended every George and Suchi office hours and they were great, staying well after the required 1 hour scheduled to answer questions. This is where most of my learning occurred, they know the material inside out and it was nice to riff about the material with someone to see if I knew it. Not to mention Suchi being a constant presence on the OMSCS Slack along with many other course alumni (looking at you, Joe). Some OMS courses students complain about the professors not being available, which is not the case here. In fact, Sasha (the professor) complained that not enough students were coming to her office hours. I would have attended more of hers but they conflicted with my work schedule. The teaching staff is solid.\n\nThe class is doable if you put in the effort, have sufficient math background, or have some intrinsic interest. I believe this is a requirement for OMSCyber so that might be motivation enough, but as an elective for OMSCS I often found myself questioning why I took this course many times throughout the semester. In the end I got the grade I wanted and I even learned some cryptography in the process. However, the biggest thing I learned is that cryptography is not for me (hey, I gave it a shot) and that I am humbled for not being as smart as I thought I was both due to seeing my peers in action as well as learning about the work of computer scientists who were able to come up with all this stuff in the first place.\n\nP.S., if you work your way through the course you might earn an invite into an elite Georgia Tech secret society that is only \"conjectured\" to exist...but I've already said too much \ud83e\udd10",

If you work for a cloud company or want to work for such - this course is a must I feel. If you are in this program for the GPA - you will definitely NOT like this course. But if you are cruising along to learn something - then this course is great. Sasha / Suchi / George / Jiahui did a great job. Also this time the professor made sure to provide an update to students on their class standing post midterm (saying this based on previous review comments)."

While the professor is brilliant, the lectures are very dry and don't really explain everything that you need to know to succeed in this class. I found myself having to consult the textbooks, piazza, and the legendary unofficial class notes from one of the TAs to succeed in this class. While that sounds reasonable, I was constantly frustrated that I couldn't find the answers from the lectures. I found the TAs, and the unofficial class notes, to be far more helpful than the professor and the lectures. I honestly wish the TAs just taught the class. While I did watch all the lectures, I probably could've skipped all of them and only read the notes and would've ended in the same spot. Besides that, I also found the hw and the quizzes frustrating. The quizzes had questions that I would classify as trick questions, and the hw was graded according to a rubric that you didn't get to see until after the fact. Both of which were frustrating because I found myself losing points even though I understood the material well. I have no problem losing points if I felt they were deserved, but that wasn't the case here. The hw rubric would knock you on things that you wouldn't even think the question warranted. They should either give the rubric when you do the hw, or phrase the questions so that they include everything expected in the rubric. Despite all of my many frustrations, I still learned a ton in this class. There was a lot of interesting stuff covered. It is very math heavy (which was fine for me). At the end of the day though, I can't see myself recommending this class to anybody unless you greatly desire to learn cryptography math proofs. Fortunately, this is a required class for many of us.",

This is my 3rd class in the program, took GIOS in the spring, and took this class along with RAIT/AI4R/whatever it's called now.\n\nPreface: I had a strong desire to learn this material. I think that really helped, because the material is not easy. However, hard in a good way - I learned a LOT.\n\nPros: \n- Lectures are solid. TAs were excellent in my semester; I see in previous reviews that this wasn't always true, but at least in Fa 2021, the TAs were awesome (all of them).\n- Homework really helped solidify the material\n- Quizzes were fair. A few reviewers thought they were tricky; I disagree. They were not just rote memorization, you really had to understand the material to get the answers correct.\n- Drop your worst homework (of 6) and worst quiz (of 12)\n- Class is curved. As in, an actual curve - professor takes the median and uses the std deviation to determine cutoffs for A/B/etc.\n- Material is difficult but is presented in a manner that allows you to learn it.\n\nCons:\n- The homeworks and tests required a bit of intuition to get correct. The HW's and lectures help develop that intuition, but, it is still possible that you fully understand the material but miss points since you didn't see an attack vector on a scheme, for instance.\n- As others have pointed out, the name \"applied\" cryptography is not really correct. There are 2 programming assignments, but they were small; I think I wrote maybe 100 lines of code total over the entire course. This, in my opinion, did not really take away from the course since I went in expecting that; just be aware.\n- Grading can take a while as everything is hand graded\n- Difficulty ramps up after the midterm, after the drop date. Not a problem for me since I was doing well after the midterm, but something to be aware of if you're already struggling with the first half of the course.\n\nOverall: I highly recommend the course if you're interested in cryptography. If you only have a passing interest in the subject, would recommend you use free online materials instead, as the class will take some work to get an A. Personally, I think I'm going to end up with a B unless I crush the final. But, this is a course where I'm OK with that - I'd prefer a B in a course where I learn a ton over an A where I learn almost nothing. I took the course along with RAIT/AI4R as I mentioned above, which was doable even with a full-time job and a family, though I rarely had any free time to myself this semester.",

                        "body": "I'm not sure what to think about this class. The setup hasn't change from previous reviews, so I won't repeat all that. I didn't find this class hard, per se, but it is purposefully set up to be tricky and I fell for a lot of the tricks. The exams are hard because they're timed, but if I had even a day to think about it, they'd be almost easy! The grading curve is hard to handle because you never quite know where you stand. The prof says she used an excel function to calculate cutoffs. She does say that the curve usually ends up being 61 - 80 as a B and 81+ as an A. If I calculated my own score correctly, I ended with 83% and I got the A, so the approximate cutoffs are probably pretty close, but no one will confirm. I do want to note that after the midterm she calculated the curve and at that time I was a solid B, so just know that there is still room to move up during the second half. \nAlso, strangely, at the end of the semester, the prof and TAs just disappeared and stopped answering questions on Piazza (this happened once during the semester, too, where everyone just disappeared for a week and the students were all wondering what was going on). During the semester there are office hours to go over solutions, and all quiz answers are unlocked so you can see the correct answers, but not with the final. I guess I'll never know what I  got wrong. So much for learning from my mistakes. \nAgain, I'm not sure how I feel overall about this course. It wasn't as hard as some reviews will lead you to believe (though I hope the guy who says this is harder than GA is right!) but it's certainly tricky. And there's a lot to do. I took this with another class and mostly neglected the other class (which was a bummer because that one was more interesting). This wasn't part of my specilization, so when I was in the thick of it I definitly wondered why I would sign up for this in the first place, but now that it's over, I guess I'm glad I did. It was definitely interesting if you can get over the frustrating. And now that it's over, I do feel like I learned a lot. ",

There were a lot of positives and negatives to taking the Applied Cryptography.\n\nPositives:\n- The instructor cares about the material and is very knowledgeable. Sasha actually conducts her own office hours (in addition to the TA-led OH), which seems to be somewhat of a rarity in this program!\n- The TAs are okay on the whole, but I want to acknowledge George for his notes and knowledge, and Jiahui for being the most responsive on Piazza\n- The programming projects are interesting and relevant, and the non-programming homework assignments provide a good opportunity to apply the material and learn; I feel the homework assignments were the best part of this class, and where most of the learning actually happened\n\nNegatives:\n- The grading process can make it hard to know where you actually stand; everything is graded on the standardize function in Excel with the mean being an 85. .5 STD above the mean is an A, and .5 below is the cutoff for the Cs (I think?). If your grades are a bit all over the place, good luck figuring out if you're on the right or wrong side of a cutoff! Additionally, midterm grades weren't back until after the drop deadline (not an issue for me, but was an issue for some classmates)\n- One more grades thing - the weighting can be tough; the two exams count for 30% each, HWs 25%, and Quizzes 15%; it would be good to see HW weighted a bit more heavily in the future!\n- The quizzes can be absolutely brutal, as can the multiple choice questions on the exams.\n- While cryptography is foundational to security, this level of depth won't apply to many jobs and roles; subjectively, this wasn't a class I was super into, which made it that much harder\n- There were a couple occasions where posts would go unresponded to on Piazza for an extended period of time\n\nOverall, if this wasn't a mandatory course, I would have skipped it. I don't anticipate needing most of the knowledge gained in the future, though if this type of material does come up again at least I've seen it once at this point.",

I learned a lot about cryptography over the semester and felt that the assignments (specifically the homework assignments) were interesting and challenging.\n\nBackground: I have an undergrad degree in mathematics, and I work in information security (although not in cryptography). This is my fourth class in the OMSCS program (taken concurrently with another course this semester).\n\nPros: The content was very interesting and engaging. I feel like the professor did a good job explaining it in the videos, and I also think that the homework assignments reflected the information by requiring proofs for novel problems that are based on the lectures. I don't feel as though anything in the course was particularly unfair: if you meet the pre-reqs in the course catalog, you should be equipped to complete the assignments and exams, especially if you put in the work. I did not need to perform \"extra research\" as mentioned in other reviews: watching the lectures and taking notes on them was enough.\n\nCons: There were times throughout the semester where Piazza had a number of unanswered questions from students for a few days at a time. The grading system is opaque and based on a curve: it is difficult to gauge where you stand in terms of a letter grade at any point during the class. Homework assignments take a while to be returned.\n\nOverall, if you have a background in / understanding of mathematics (especially number theory and probability) and are interested in learning more about cryptography from an academic standpoint, I would recommend this class.",

I've taken another cryptography course at a different school in my undergrad but performed mediocrely. I hoped to take this course to solidify what I learned in the previous course (or vice-versa), but ended up completely regretting enrolling in this course. As others have stated, this course is taught at a high level, and you are expected to do some external research to stay afloat. \n\nThe information taught in lecture is bare-bones compared to what is expected for homework and the exams. I am aware that people have reached out to the TAs for help for certain questions on assignments on Piazza, but unfortunately the TAs never make any of those posts public (my own fault for not reaching out myself, though I've managed to get by). That being said, there is little in the way of examples for proofs or questions in the lectures, so I've always felt unprepared for homework/exams. We aren't taught how to question proposed encryption/signing schemes or offered some intuition as to how to approach these problems. Like I said, it seems we are very much expected to pour hours into research (but also aren't provided alternative resources to look through). \n\nThe BlueJeans sessions are moderately helpful ONLY IF George is leading the session. He provides commentary to actually get you to understand the material, as well as some written explanation for more visual learners. Professor Boldyreva is very unapproachable, offering condescending remarks if you ask about something you don't understand (\"did you not watch the lecture video?\"). To put it bluntly, she makes you feel stupid for even asking questions or proposing alternative solutions. Her explanations of solutions also feel incomplete or maybe under the assumption that we understand the background concepts completely. \n\nI also have a qualm with the \"standardized grading\" scheme that the professor uses, since it guarantees that the bottom 20% or so of the class is guaranteed to fail. People enrolled in the program are working full-time and are not at the bottom 20% for a lack of trying (I suppose it is more fair than failing the entire class, given the average for the midterm was ~71.75%).\n\nOverall, I would not recommend this course at all, unless you have the time to do a lot of external research and are okay with only higher-level lectures with limited examples.\n\nAdmittedly, I did come out of the course learning a lot about cryptographic schemes, and definitely have a better understanding of how cryptography is applicable in the real world than before, but a moderate understanding the higher level material is meaningless during the final/midterm where intuition and some experience with proofs is necessary.

This is a very theoretical course, more than I was expecting. This is not a bad thing just something to keep in mind if you are considering taking it. It does not go into exactly how AES works specifically for example, but goes in depth on how we can prove that certain symmetric schemes which AES is built from are indeed secure.\n\nI also enjoyed the pace of the course. It is different from other classes that are project heavy with AC having weekly MCQ quizzes and almost bi-weekly homeworks. If you can keep up with the homeworks and quizzes and do the practice midterm/final then you should be fine.",

The material is complicated enough that I wanted to work through it with others.\n\nTo that end, I loved the course and community around the course.\n\nBriefly, the course is divided into halves: first symmetric encryption (where parties share a key) and then asymmetric (where they do not). Each half starts at the basics in that area and slowly builds to more and more complicated systems.\n\nThere are weekly quizzes which are somewhat annoying but the bulk of the learning happens around the 'homeworks', which are often some variation of \"here's a scheme, prove its insecurity\". It's encouraged to work through these problems in a small group, which was great. Finding attacks often involves some element of intuition, and it may often be the case that you'll see that spark for one problem, and a group-mate will see it for another.\n\nExams are similarly structured to the homeworks but somewhat easier, which is good, since \"write 3 proofs in 2 hours\" is stressful enough on its own. At least exams are open book, so you don't need to bother memorizing the AES construction or something.\n\nWhile the material is in some sense inherently difficult, there are a lot of resources provided to help you get up to speed: the lecture videos themselves which are quite comprehensive, several detailed student-created lecture notes, and two books with parallel material if you care to dig in deeper. And at least in the case of Fall 2020, the student community in the slack channel was also very helpful if hyperactive at times. <3 from Mystery\n\nIdeally you'll come out the other side of this class with a good understanding of cryptographic schemes as used in practice and an intuition for identifying flaws and insecurities in cryptographic schemes.",

I do software engineering for my day job which is unrelated to security and cryptography.\n\nContrary to others who find this course hard, I find it manageable(~94% overall). I took this class and computer vision together while working. I found computer vision to be the more time consuming one with a lot of parameter tuning. \n\nIt is possible to team up for assignments but I found doing everything individually very rewarding. I generally spent entire alternative weekends watching crypto videos and doing assignments. Assignments can all be completed in less than one day. \n\nThe courses are short and concise(In fact, I think that the lectures are so short that the professor recorded videos and then make them two times slower so as to bring lecture time to reasonable range).\nHowever, the class also skipped some details which the professor believed to be not important). Rewatching lectures are very important. The concepts seem very hard in the beginning but it will all make sense eventually if you watch it many times. I did not have time to read lecture notes unfortunately due to my packed schedule. However, I did watch some [coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/crypto) crypto videos and find those to complement this class well. For example, AES/DES was not explained in this class; Merkle damgard is also not explained in this class but both are well explained in the coursera class. \n\nOverall, I think that this is a solid course but it is also very basic. The lectures give basic coverage of modern cryptography and even on how to make random number generators. The first half of the course is more proof heavy which is good. However, for the second half, there is not much proofs probably because of gap in number theory(harder if missing background). I wish there could be optional videos on the number theory facts that professor presented. Everything is in the lectures note though so a hardworking person who can finish the lecture notes must be able to get a lot out of it. \n\nI hope that there are more advanced contents covered and we spent less time using formal security definitions/wording but more time on building intuition and scaling those up. While formal definitions are important, most people will never use it. However, understanding problems and evaluating solutions can generally be very helpful.",

The first half covers symmetric encryption about PRF'S, MAC,HMAC, INDCCA, INDCCP, UFCMA, etc... Interesting topics can get challenging really quick. But those concepts are applied to the second part of the course of asymmetric encryption alongside some number theory which isn't bad.\n\nThe quizzes in the first half were tricky but that is the case granted with most true/false. Second half the quizzes were the same little tricks in the questions just need to make sure you read what is being asked.\n\nThe homeworks you get to be in a group form a good group to bounce ideas off of the homeworks ar very important in the class. 2 coding homeworks rest are short response. \n\nThe exams are tough long and wordy you need to be able to dissect the material they want quickly on the exams or you will be up the creek without a paddle on them. Practice practice problems be collaborative on slack and piazza remember this class is hard do not stress but learn from others. \n\nThe TAs are all basically absent except George and Yunna. To be honest the rest shouldn't be part of the course there are much better TA options for potential TAs this semester in our course who would love to do it and actually engage with the students which is cool in an online program. \n\nProfessors Office Hours are great shes smart, has a sense of humor and has cool stories you should ask her about Patagonian cypress trees when she has them up haha! \n\nThe worse part of this course was kind of towards the end it took roughly a month for them to grade homework 5 and the final exam didnt allow for regrades for them to understand our gradescope submissions.  If they didn't wait so long to start grading they could have had the results sooner and done regrades. \n\nAlas i am done with the course but thank you for reading this and despite my last paragraph the course content is great i really hope the professor does eventually a 2nd part to the course or a little quantum shes super smart and really is passionate about the subject.

I have always perceived cryptography as an extension of information security. To me information security is a boring accumulation of obscure knowledge and hacks. \n\nApplied Cryptography isn't about arcana and gotchas. It provides a beautiful framework to build secure applications that are changing the world. The math is challenging but not impossible and is frequently beautiful. You will struggle in this class if you have not taken discrete math or took it so long ago you have forgotten combinatorics, proofs, and modular arithmetic. I redid discrete mathematics concurrently with this course.\n\nDr. Sasha's lectures are excellent. I found the Slack channel very helpful full of wonderful, funny nerds. My best moment was finally grasping Galois Fields.\n\nWe had a wonderful TA in George Kudrayvtsev (yes, that George!). Who was extremely responsive on Slack and Piazza.\n\nMy greatest gripe about this course is that there isn't second part to it. It is an introductory course to crypto. It does not cover elliptic curves, zero commitments, or zero knowledge proofs. AC II is really needed.",

I found myself resorting to free material on the internet (Khan Academy) to figure out what was actually going on. Basically, she will jump straight into the mathematical steps without actually explaining the gist of it. Other issues that previous reviewers have stated are true and accurate (i.e. unexplained syntax, etc). The material in this class fails to abide by principals taught in any entry-level technical writing class.\n\nI would still recommend taking it. I feel that the feedback to the professor is fairly universal, and I hope that she will take the feedback and improve, because she is a brilliant cryptographer. I can only imagine that the course will continue to improve, so it's likely that you'll have a better experience than what we had. That being said, expect to spend significant amounts of time outside of the course material provided. You'll likely have to look things up on your own a lot.\n\nRe the review @ 11/20/2020, 3:51:23 PM: To insinuate that the previous negative reviewers were \"salty\" because they didn't want to use their brain is both immature and elitist. These previous reviewers are intelligent people with very valid concerns about this class. It was genuinely low quality.",

If you answered \"No\" to any question, but especially the last, don't ever think of taking this class. You will be as salty as the reviewers below.\n\nI am currently in the class and this is my 4th course in the program, and it is a very good course.\n\n### **The Subject**\nThis throws off many people who come in expecting to learn about the intricacies of AES or SHA-3. Sorry, no cookies for you!  \n\nApplied Cryptography courses in every reputed university cover the theoretical basis for cryptography - how to  build a scheme from secure building blocks and how to prove security. This means the content is **very** theoretical and mathematical, as it should be. What the others forgot to mention is it is **AMAZING** stuff.  \n\nAlso, why the hell are you trying to learn in a graduate level course something you can look up for free in an RFC on the internet?\n\n**Lectures**   \nThe lectures are very crisp, and cover all the math you need for the course itself. You may have to watch some of them multiple times to understand, but they are really well done.   \nUse George's notes as reference, they are very useful and well-written and worth their page count in money, but luckily they are free (you can donate to him if you like).     \n\n### **The Grade**  \n**Quizzes**  \nQuizzes are weekly. 4-5 questions, take less than 5 minutes to do. Some questions are tricky but you could lose a lot of points and still do well overall since they have a low weightage.  \n\n**Homeworks**  \nHomeworks are usually 4 problems and due every other week approximately, with one week time to work on them. All HW and quiz solutions were discussed in OH's which was good.  \nThere are 2 coding projects. The first one was more fun than the second, and first took me 7 hours, second took me maybe 2. Hoping they will add more in the future. \n\n**Exams**  \nThe exams have questions that look similar to the quizzes and homeworks combined (but problems easier than the HWs). Not easy, but ok.\n\n### **The People**\n**Instructors**  \nThe professor knows her subject and is interested in teaching; but she is also not good at interacting with people, and she sometimes comes across rude or condescending and makes it hard to ask her questions confidently.  \nThankfully, George is a very helpful TA. I don't know who the other TA's are, didn't see them around much.   \n\n**Piazza**  \nThe Piazza was useful- Sasha and George and some of the students answered very promptly, but it was not noisy like some other classes.  \n\n**Slack**  \nThis **was** a problem because it was very noisy and some students got too active on the Slack channel while not even discussing crypto, so I had to stay away.\n\n### General Tips\n1. Like somebody else pointed below, you are allowed to form Homework groups of 3, definitely do that and try to get the smart ones on your group. \n2. As with any class, be smart and start early. If you start late, you will probably whine. \n3. Stay away from the Slack if you are busy or if you hate wasting your time",

I think this subject has actually been my favorite out of all 6 OMSCS courses I've completed so far.\n- The homework assignments were an appropriate level of difficulty and reinforced concepts taught in the lectures. They were challenging enough that I felt rewarded when I finally figured out the answer.\n- Office hours were held regularly (and importantly, recorded) to help students understand answers to past assignments and clarify expectations about the current assignments.\n- The professor and TAs were active on Piazza.\n- The overall workload and pace of the course is good. I didn't feel overworked but I also didn't feel bored.\n\nThings that could be improved:\n- The media player (on mediaspace.gatech.edu) does not remember my playback speed preference, so I have to set it to 1.25x for for every single video (about 20 per module usually). This is a small thing but is really annoying.\n- In other OMSCS courses, the lectures are more interactive, i.e. they have occasional quizzes and challenges embedded. However, all of the lectures for this course are entirely pre-recorded videos. I prefer having the more interactive lectures as I find they keep me engaged. This might be a limitation of the video platform (Udacity vs GT Mediaspace).\n- There were some minor hiccups with Canvas, e.g. assignments having incorrect dates and not opening at the correct times. I'm sure this will improve in future iterations of the course.\n- It would have been interesting to learn more about current trends in cryptography in both industry and research. There was a section in the last lecture which listed topics we didn't cover: secure multi-party communication, merkle trees and blockchain, and post-quantum crypto \u2014 I would've loved to learn more about those topics.\n\nRegarding some of the other reviews that describe the instructor or TAs as \"defensive\" or unhelpful \u2014\u00a0I did not feel this way \u2014 quite the opposite. They did a good job clarifying assignments when necessary and being responsive on Piazza and office hours.",

I knew that it was going to be difficult when the syllabus listed 81-100 for \"A\", 61-80 for \"B\", and 41-60 for \"C\".  Ouch.\n\nThis was the most difficult, challenging, and frustrating class I have taken so far.\n\nThe class seemed very long on theory, and very short on practice.  I watched every lecture at least twice, spent hours reviewing the lecture notes and still would get tripped up by tricky wording on the quizzes.\n\nIt was disappointing to me that all of the office hours happened during normal working hours.  That's probably entirely sensible and practical for traditional students, e.g. full-time graduate students, but definitely not the greatest for a person working a normal work week.",

It's a recommended resource for this class, and it gives you a feel for what you can expect from an applied crypto class. I think it surprised some people that there are a lot of math and proofs involved. The closest class I can think of for comparison would be Graduate Algorithms.\n\nIn my semester, the final grades were split (nearly) equally between the homeworks, quizzes, the midterm, and the final. The homeworks were usually a few written problems (often proving schemes insecure) which ranged from medium to quite challenging. The quiz questions were usually True/False (sometimes multiple choice), but required a pretty good grasp of the material in order to do well on them. The midterm and final were mixtures of written problems (similar to homework) and multiple choice (similar to quizzes).\n\nThe professor and TAs were very available and helpful. There were multiple office hours a week, and the professor answered lots of questions personally. I have not seen that before in OMSCS. I have seen some people say they thought the staff was unhelpful or even condescending, but I did not feel that way at all. \n\nThis was my last course in the OMSCS program, and it was my favorite. I also found it to be the most difficult (although not the most time consuming) - more so than GA, ML, or CV. However, I felt the challenges were fair. My only complaint about the class was that some logistical issues were not completely worked out in the first semester when I took it. \n\nTips:\n\n* You're allowed to get into groups of three to do the homeworks. DO THIS. I did not for the first homework, and it was my worst grade (luckily they dropped the lowest homework and quiz). There was a problem or two that was difficult enough that I may not have gotten the answer without three people thinking about it.\n* Print out the lecture slides and take notes on them as you watch lectures. I started doing this based on advice from someone in Piazza and it greatly improved my quiz grades. This is also useful for the midterm/final, since you can use your notes. You'll end up with a big stack of paper at the end, but it's worth it.",

Expect frequent piazza non-answers such as \"I think the homework instructions are clear\" from the professor. Good luck sorting through the random mix of messages from canvas, piazza, emails, announcements on both platforms etc. trying to find anything you're looking for. I spent over 30 minutes looking for office hour recordings at one point. \n\nThe lectures are unlabelled and impossible to sort through. The assignment due dates keep changing because the instruction team can't seem to release homework on time. It seems like everyone here's first time using Piazza and Canvas. Maybe they'll get better. \n\nAll that being said, the material isn't incredibly hard. I found myself spending 10 to 15 hours per week on the homework and the midterm is open note. Make sure to print screen captures of the things written on slides during the lecture that aren't included in the PDFs for the midterm. "

The homeworks were interesting, challenging, and helped reinforce the concepts.  The TAs and Professor were both active on Piazza.  \n\nCons: The quizzes were worded quite trickily at times, almost Joyner-esque, but they weren't open book so it was an extra challenge.  The only other Con was a result of this being the first run of the course, some things were a little disorganized, but they'll almost certainly be fixed for next semester and the Professor was very quick in rectifying the few hiccups we encountered.   \n\nOverall, a great class that I would take again.
