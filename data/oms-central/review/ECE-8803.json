A lot of the time extra materials and information for the projects were given two weeks after the project was released. This caused a lot of undue stress for the students for the more difficult projects. What it mostly came down to is that if you do your fair share of work you'll get a lot of partial credit for the problem. Don't worry about being 100% correct, just show your work and make a concerted effort.",
