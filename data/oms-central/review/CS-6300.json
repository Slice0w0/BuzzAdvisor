I have no CS background at all, but just completed the Java course recommended on the program application page. As my first official CS course and as I have very little CS knowledge, I think this course let me learn a lot useful and practical knowledge and it's not very hard to pick up. At the beginning of this course, the assignments help you master different important tool that we will need for group project. I think it is not hard, but just make sure you can spend time to learn and apply. As for group project, you cannot select who will be your team member. Group project is not very hard I think, but you need to spend time to learn and apply. It will become challenging if your group has less than 3 active contributors to the project. As for the final individual project, it is still going on and I don't have valid feedback on it yet. I think if you have experience on software development from your daily job, or you learn something similar in school, probably you won't learn much from this course. If you have learn Java, I think you can do good in this course, just make sure you can spend about 7-15 hours per week if needed to go deep and learn. ",

One assignment (Assignment 6) is particularly challenging, heavily weighted, and centers on formal logic. It feels disconnected from the rest of the course material, making it difficult and frustrating.\n\nThe group project was also a major drawback. I ended up with teammates who had little to no prior development experience, which required me to spend around 30 hours per week teaching them and completing the majority of the project on my own. This experience was frustrating enough that I've decided to avoid group projects for the rest of my degree.\n\nOverall, I wouldn\u2019t recommend this course for those with software development experience. The material doesn\u2019t reflect common industry practices, and the group project can be awful if you\u2019re paired with inexperienced teammates.",

The group project, which was designing a simple Android app, gave me the opportunity to work in a team and got a taste of both frontend and backend development. Grading was also great. Almost all assignments were submitted to GS with unlimited submissions, no hidden cases, and immediate release of grade. Generous extra credits were provided.",

The group project and every assignment until assignment 6 isn't difficult and can be done in about 10 hours or so a week. Maybe less depending on your experience. Try to stay on top of the group project because it is pretty easy to get \"bad\" teammates (bad teammates imo are people who either don't know much AND aren't willing to learn or teammates who don't contribute at all).\n\nSo here we go with the rant. Assignment 6 is the worst. It's not because of the assignment itself and the goals of the assignment. It is a terrible assignment because of how poorly it is written. Asking questions about A6 on the discussion forums doesn't help either because the TAs are genuinely useless and give the most vague answers. \n\nIf you are a TA or professor for this course, you should be deeply ashamed of yourself for how pathetic of an assignment you have created. Don't be a TA if you're going to give useless replies to questions or not even respond. After everyone received their grades (which is whole other issue, it takes weeks to just grade assignments when there is an autograder. It doesn't even make sense for how long it takes to grade and input grades/scores), the forums were up in flames. There were at least a dozen or so posts about A6 regarding the poor grading and questions that A6 asked. So what did the TAs or professors do? Nothing. They simply replied \"sorry\" and were never to be seen again. I, like many others in my class, went from a high A (97+) to a high B (87-89) with just 1 assignment. The worst part is that A6 is only a week only assignment and is worth the most, yet the group project which goes on for almost 2 months is barely worth anything. \n\nIf you can avoid taking this class, do it. It's actually a disgrace for this class to be in a great program such as OMSCS. "

My main take away was learning how to use git properly and code integration in a team setting. Some of the cons of the course was that you aren't able to select your team - I appreciate the staff grouping people in the same time zone together but some of my team preferred to work on things last minute while others preferred to work on things early which made it challenging. I also had a personal situation come up during the group project and there are no special considerations for the group project. I didn't know my team and didn't want to be a burden so contributed as best as I could which made dealing with my personal situation challenging. I can see how anyone working in software engineering may not find this course particularly stimulating, a comment from someone working in the industry was that their experience is that things work very differently in the workplace now. Overall I finished the course with a high A so I would not rate this very high in terms of difficulty and would recommend this course for anyone who is not a software developer.",

                        "body": "My background: I graduated with a bachelor's degree in CS last summer, and started working as a Java developer earlier this year. This was my second course in the OMSCS program, and I got an A with a 95%. The only assignment where I didn't score above 90 was Assignment 6. It's a tricky one, so watch out.\n\nOverall, this course is fine, not bad at all. It provides structure and teaches foundational aspects of the software development, including version control, testing, and the software development lifecycle. If you haven't learned these before, you'll find the course very useful. However, if you've taken similar courses or have been a professional developer, you might find it too easy and potentially disappointing.\n\nThe course is graded based on 6 different assignments, 1 group project, and 1 individual project. The first five assignments are very easy and straightforward, if you have any Java and Git experience, you can probably complete each one within 1 or 2 hours. To be honest, I almost forgot I was taking the course during this time because the assignments were so easy.\n\nAfter the first five assignments, we started the group project. In this course, the TAs randomly select your teammates, which I think no other course does. This can lead to very different experiences depending on your group. I've read some horror stories here and on Reddit, so I was a bit nervous. However, I had a great team. Everyone was great, punctual, and professional. We almost got 100% on our group project grade, so my experience was excellent. The group project itself wasn\u2019t hard, but it was busy because of the group work. It required some time for meetings, and there was also peer pressure to perform well.\n\nThen there's Assignment 6, which like everyone said has the biggest potential to lower your grade. I believe the average score for this assignment in the previous semester was in the 60s, and for us, it was in the 70s. In comparison, the average score for almost every other assignment (including group projects and individual project) in the class is above 90%. So, there's a significant drop. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s difficult, but it is very tricky, and you need to answer questions in great detail. The TAs will only give you half credit if your explanations aren't clear, which happened to me. This is the only assignment where I didnt scored above 90%, for all the other assignments, I scored 95% and above.\n\nAs for the individual assignment, I found it to be alright. It basically requires you to write code using TDD. So if you haven't worked with TDD before, this could be a good learning opportunity.\n\nSo in the end, i'd say if you're unfamiliar with Git, testing, Java, or OOP, you might actually struggle with this course, but learning a lot. On the other hand, if you have experience working as a professional software developer, you'll likely find the course too easy. So I think this course is ideal for someone who knows just Java and OOP but has no experience with version control, testing, or working in a team. If that describes you, you'll find this course very useful.\n\nHowever, personally, I think this course might be the easiest one in the OMSCS program for me. It feels like a second-semester freshman course that's been rebranded as a graduate course.  I can't imagine any other course being easier than this. (Don't get me wrong, it's easy, but it's still useful.)",

The assignments are not terribly difficult, and the level of Java needed for the programming can easily be acquired with some extra hours of study.   There is one assignment where grading is very harsh (a large part has no partial credit) but the rest are OK.  There is a team project which is challenging, and the TAs pick your teammates, so there is a bit of luck required there.  One downside it is seems that for the non-autograder assignments, grades are slow to be returned.  Overall, I recommend this class.",

It really is hard to screw up.\n\nAssignment 6, the assignment some reviews are complaining about, asks us to follow if/else tree branches. I don't know how they are tanking that assignment, but if you have done reasonably well in any other OMSCS class, I assure you that you'll be fine.\n\nThe only possible hurdle you will face in this class are groupmates who are AFK or don't know how to code.

I took this course with ML. \n\nWhat most reviews fail to clarify is that even though this is an easy course, it is really easy to get a B (even a C). It is okay to not devote a lot of time to this course, but you cannot afford to lose a lot of marks because median for most assignments is 100 (!!). It was 97 for Group Project, and 91 for Individual Project. A6 will probably decide your grade (median 75).\n\nMy practical 2c:\n1. Double check your submissions: Wrong names or locations of files during submission are penalized. In some cases, they perform sanity checks using autograder but not always.\n2. Assignment 6 is essentially a puzzle. If you reach the correct answer, you will know. If you have doubts about your submission, you are very likely missing something. \n3. Watch Ed videos based on the assigned schedule (simply clicking the videos works).\n4. For Group Project, make sure all the docs are present and are well done.\n\nSDP with ML? In the current setup, SDP is a good blend with ML since there are no clashes. ML P1 clashes with an initial SDP assignment which is super-easy, P2, P3 were due mid-week. P4 clashes with SDP Individual project which was gradescope based, and once I got a 100, I could switch my focus to ML completely.\n\nPros\n1. One of the few courses where the original course creator / professor is still active and TAs are actually just TAs.\n2. Inspite of being a tricky course, it is well designed for someone with no background. Pairing with a harder course is possible since SDP does not require you to put in a lot of hours. \n3. The assigments descriptions are really well written with a lot of emphasis on what is expected.\n4. I feel great that with zero background, I could work on an Android app, learn about software testing, develop a Java application. All this while putting in >30 hours/week for ML consistenty.\n\nCons\n1. Group Project pairing is random and you might end up doing a great chunk of the assigned work.\n2. A6 felt like a 'all or nothing' highschool puzzle which was really irritating. I felt really bad seeing posts from other classmates who lost a lot of marks.\n3. Similar to A6, IP deliverable 1 also felt like a puzzle with a lot of emphasis on finding hidden scenarios without feedback.\n4. The workload and weightage of assignments is not evenly distributed.

The group project is the only uncertainty in the class, but since I have some experience, I had the mindset of not minding to do the full-stack whole project myself. However, the teammates that were assigned to me were relatively responsible. They took care every single bit of their responsibility upon agreeing the Delivery 2. The `Individual Project` is a practice of test-driven development which was novel to me since my company is a startup, once we receive the requirements, we just start coding.",

You are left to play with Android Studio that too a specific version that the Gradescope uses to assess else you are doomed to fail even though your code is right. \n- The worst part is that the assignments are released every week. So you can't work ahead. The TAs give a stupid reason for this that everyone must learn together and ask questions and stay connected. This is exactly not OMSCS. OMSCS is supposed to be decentralized and asynchronous.\n- TAs are lazy. For one assignment Gradescope gave me same string for expected and actual output where I couldn't understand what's the issue. The TAs responded that is how gradescope works and we can't help you.\n- You lose marks if you have bad teammates. My team was not that great and I did most of the work and eventually lost marks as some features that were delegated were missing from the final application.",

Therefore, I expected to struggle with some of the concepts in the course (especially for anything regarding database expertise on the group project).\n\nAssignments 1-6 were very doable for a person with little to no Java experience. Most of the prior reviews highlight Assignment 6 as being tricky and weighted at 15%-18% of the total grade in the class, but I thought that was fair giving how Assignment 6 required something more beyond rote coding. If you can read directions and perform simple mathematical operations to double-check your own math, then Assignment 6 will only help to bolster your grade (100% is very achievable for all assignments).\n\nThe Group Project is where I would recommend you put a lot of effort into being a good teammate and making all the documentation as thorough as possible. Even if your final application is somewhat error-prone, your Group Project grade can still be high/strong as long as your documentation deliverables are high-quality documents. This is where it helps if you have people who are good at writing as well as coding in your arena.\n\nThe Individual Project is less about Java skills and more about...battling the antiquated tool of TSL Generator and then trying to beat hidden Gradescope test cases. I would recommend not putting in excessive hours into beating every single test case unless you have the time and energy to do so - the reward is not that large for getting all test cases beat. \n\nThe TAs were very responsive on Ed Discussion. Many of the students just plain do not read instructions or just ask the same questions again and again on Ed Discussion. Sometimes I wish there were negative points awarded to people for being so sloppy in how they handled assignment materials before posting public questions to Ed Discussion that revealed their lack of thoroughness in the course.",

If you read no further, know this: if you already have a job in software development, this is not a useful class. It hits all the basics, and is arguably more of an undergrad level course. I had a course in my CS bachelors at a large state school that was almost the exact same content.\n\nProblems I had with the course included: \n\n- A wild imbalance of work between weeks, with no ability to work ahead. The first half of the course has assignments that will take you 30-60 minutes. The second half suddenly throws a lot of more complex work at you, including doubling up the most difficult assignment deadline with the group project deadline. The individual \"project\" at the end only really gives 1 weekend to work on each part, unlike the rest of the assignments in which you always have 2 weekends to do work. \n\n- A wild imbalance of grade weighting. Many have spoken here about how 15% of your grade comes down to assignment 6. It is the most difficult assignment, but I would not call it a brain teaser. It's a bit more like writing geometry proofs...except no one taught you how to write them. It takes a lot of careful thinking, despite it being a low volume of actual coding/writing. It's not impossible, but it doesn't feel reflective of the assignment weight, as the concepts are based in very specific theories around testing. It feels like it came from a different course. \n\n- Despite being called \"projects\", the group and individual projects little little to no room for your own creativity or interests. You complete work exactly as described in a detailed specification. If you have experience making Android apps or coding in Java, it is pretty uninteresting (in my opinion). In the case of doing the group project, I felt like I was doing a job in which I was not getting paid to create a product that will never ship. It felt like a waste of time. \n\n- Assignment specifications are written up in google docs. Many of them are 5-10 pages long. TAs will change or add things while the assignment is open, despite the fact that you may have already turned in and stopped working for the week. Because it's a google doc, it can be unclear when changes were made, or even if changes were made. You are still responsible for following the specifications at the end. \n\n- Most of the assignments are manually graded. You don't have a good idea of how you are doing pretty much until the end of the course. The assignments with any meaningful weight don't come with any evaluation criteria or rubric. We are simply told to do a \"suitable\" or \"sufficient\" job at the task. The TAs will then comb through and nitpick solutions. I never experienced grading that felt unfair, but it leaves one with a feeling of disempowerment. How can we succeed without a clear definition of success? \n\n- I got a faint whim of disdain towards students at times in assignment specifications. The way things are written sometimes feel like staff is...annoyed? by students. On one occasion, there was a threat to deduct points on an assignment for asking a specific question on Ed. Perhaps I read into things too much, but I was ill at ease sometimes. \n\n- There are times TAs refuse to answer questions you ask on the forum and ask you to come to office hours instead. This is not accessible for students with busy schedules, families, jobs, in different timezones, etc. \n\n- There is a group project. It wasn't a terrible project, I guess, but it inevitably leads to having to adjust your schedule to accommodate others, which can be stressful. Not really the fault of the course, just an inevitable annoyance to be aware of.\n\n\nThings that seemed okay about the course: \n\n- The lectures are well presented, even if only on basic topics\n\n- There are regular office hours if you want to have live conversations with staff \n\n- The assignments are, at least, pretty detailed and you have a good idea of exactly what to build \n\nThis class may be ok in a spring or fall semester in which the schedule is a little more stretched out. Would I call it an \"easy\" A? Not really. I got an A, but it was actually the first course in which I was not certain I would get an A up until the very end, due to obscure grading criteria and the slow pace of getting grades back.  I think many people can end up with a B because of assignment 6--or worse if you don't pull weight in the group project. The content can be extremely easy at times, but more difficult at others. I don't think you can coast. I haven't taken graduate algorithms, but my impression is that this is still less painful than that class, so if you are going for the II specialization, it's still worth taking this course over that one. Otherwise, I'd skip it. You're better off getting a 10 week internship (or just, yknow, a job), where you'd learn twice as much about software dev process AND get paid.\n",

The group assignment was fun, had to make an android app and found myself carrying the weight of the team in the development front, we had ghost teammate that didn't show up for the first 2 weeks. The Individual project was interesting, didn't have as much fun with TSLGenerator, it is an interesting tool and I can see its uses for TDD.\n\nPros- good course as a warmup in the summer, good to get your grades up, provided you are honest consistent and disciplined in your efforts.\n\nCons- The timing for A6 and the group projects final deliverable are weird. They're due on the same day, while the group project takes several weeks to deliver you get only a week for A6 and they're somehow weighted almost equally. I did very well on A6 relative to the class but I don't feel like I learned anything great in that assignment. It feels more like a riddle than a programming assignment.\n \nThis class overall seemed pretty medium in difficulty. The caveat is, the beginning is a cake walk while the end of the semester is critical. I found myself spending roughly 2-4 hours a week in the first half while I spent roughly 20 hours in the final 4 few weeks of the semester.",

                        "body": "While I develop software at my job, it is not in a capacity that requires a robust, structured development process, and I don't do it in a team of many people all working on the same code base at the same time. That is why I chose to take this course, to get a fundamental understanding of git and software development processes in general. For someone like me this course is great. I got exactly what I desired from this class. \n\nIf you're someone who develops software in a collaborative team full-time, some aspects of this class will probably be somewhat mundane to you. That being said, learning about the different methods of software development and each method's pros and cons can still be somewhat interesting.\n\nFor the summer semester the first 5 weeks were lectures and 5 assignments. This part of the class was pretty easy. You do have to keep up with lectures. These assignments don't take a huge amount of time unless you're completely foreign to Java (Assignment 1-3), or if you've never created a basic app with buttons, textboxes, etc. (Assignment 4 is a basic android app). I had some experience in both, but not much, and I didn't struggle much with it. Some googling solved all of my problems.\n\nWeeks 6-8 were a group project where your team creates an android app and a lot of documentation for the app. Assignment 6 was also due on week 8. All of this is done while keeping up with lectures. For the group project teams were 3-4 people. My team had 4 and then 1 member dropped the class. The app and the documentation does take quite a bit of time. These 3 weeks were the most busy and my team was up late every sunday night. It didn't help that in week 8 both the finalized group project and Assignment 6 were due at the same time. My team was pretty good though. All 3 people pulled their weight for the most part and we barely missed getting a 100%. I highly recommend making a spreadsheet of tasks that need to be completed and have each person on the team put their name to the tasks they're going to complete. That really mitigates two people working on the same thing for any amount of time. Communication is key!\n\nWeeks 9-11 were an individual project. Again, that is completed while keeping up with lectures. The individual project did take some time but not as much as the group project. I thought the individual project was actually fairly interesting. You're given the specification of a program. Part 1 is creating test cases for that program using a text file with parameters and then running an executable that turns that into a list of test cases. Part 2 is implementing those test cases. Gradescope compares your test cases to the test cases that you're expected to cover. This can be frustrating because you don't know what all of cases you're supposed to cover are. You're supposed to come up with all of them based on the program specifications, but you end up adding test cases or changing your test cases and resubmitting and seeing what Gradescope says. If you're methodical about it you can eventually figure it out. Part 3 is implementing the program that your test cases were testing. Up until this part the 100% correct program has always been in the black box that is gradescope. Now you're creating that program and all of your test cases have to pass against it, as well as additional gradescope test cases that will ensure your implementation is correct.\n\nOverall the course was not very difficult in my opinion. Weeks 1-5 were pretty easy. Weeks 6-8 were quite time consuming. Week 8 was the worst with the final group project due and Assignment 6. That was not fun. Weeks 9-11 was a little harder and more time consuming than weeks 1-5, but still fairly easy. I recommend this class.",

My group project team wasn't the greatest either, when it came time to code I did most of the project but your experience may vary. The other projects were pretty lame and I didn't learn much, if anything, from them either. Assignment 6 was brutal too, if you miss tiny parts it tanks your grade. The lectures are pretty well done but you can tell how old they are. Although material doesn't change, a refresh would show that they actually put some more effort into the class. I took a Software Engineering class in undergrad and it covered basically all the same material. Maybe if you don't work in Tech this class would be helpful otherwise it's an easy enough A. Very disappointing for a 'grad' level class. ",

It\u2019s basically solving their testing riddles, and if you don\u2019t get it exactly right, you can easily get a terrible grade on that one assignment and get a B in the course.\n- Assignment documentation is frustrating and unnecessarily confusing with how they use placeholders for file path names",

I enjoyed building the android app in group project and a4. I took 2 subjects and this was essentially the easier one with other being more difficult and core subject. This course took away a lot of time from my main course and it was annoying and then disheartening to trip over a trick assignment and end up with a B.

I'm guessing these reviews come from people already in the software industry (or industry adjacent), or from people that aren't familiar with coding/software development at all.  While the course material itself is pretty uninspiring (I mean how exciting can you make software development process really?), the Professor and TAs have been really responsive and excited about the material.  We have easy access to them as resources, and they all seem knowledgeable and willing to help (to a certain extent obviously).\n\nWhat I really like about this course are the assignments.  Yeah there are a few that I found frustrating and overly fussy about the details but I can definitely see and appreciate the rationale behind them.  While not a career coder and after not having worked with Java for years, I have seen my fair share of courses and projects that involved coding.  The assignments in this course were pretty rewarding to get right.  Some were actually pretty fun.  None of them were so challenging that I began the assignment with absolutely no idea what to do (which has not been the case in other courses).\n\nOne of the most useful aspects of this course for non-software professionals is the extensive use of Github for code management.  While seemingly tedious and mysterious at first, once we got to intensively use it assignment after assignment, I find myself very comfortable at the end of the semester utilizing it in an efficient and meaningful way to manage version control.\n\nFor me this course was a confidence-booster in the coding arena after getting hammered in other more intensive courses.  It wasn't so difficult that I wanted to pull my hair out at 4AM, hours before an assignment is due.\n\nSpeaking of assignments, there is one due each and every week.  This can become a time-management problem if you find yourself with a particularly busy week (work, sick kids, vacation, etc.).  So plan ahead.  Some weeks the assignments aren't going to take a proficient coder more than a few hours, others may take more since not all involve coding (producing documents, doing other non-coding problems).\n\nOverall I really liked this course and found most of the assignments fun and rewarding.",

I had to spend lot of time to understand what the Individual Project (last 5 weeks of the course) was asking for, but once that is clear things were not too bad. The best part of this course which I liked in particular was the group project where I learned quite a lot on know-hows of git collaboration to build something together to get an essence of Agile development. There is a 15% load to Assignment6 which looks easy but was fairly tough, I got only 52/100 and score in this single assignment determines who gets A and B. I do have one thing to complain about this course is lack of any sort of direction when stuck in determining the test cases for individual project. It is always a standard answer. At the end students never come to know the tricks to get better test coverage. I understand why they cannot share all that but this thing hurts learning a lot and students. I gave up after trying a number of times just because I had no idea on where to spend my time on. ",

                        "body": "Negatives:\n- very high variation in workload based on the week, some weeks are brutal\n- you cannot front-load work, as assignments are released weekly; this was really unfortunate\n- group project is stressful and rushed; grading can be harsh if unlucky\n- one assignment is worth 15% of your grade, but can end up really hurting you grade\n- TAs can be quite unhelpful and are paranoid of information being shared on Ed, that would otherwise be helpful. The information sharing environment is the complete opposite of KBAI or HCI. One TA in particular really ground my gears with their unhelpful responses...\n- assignment requirements are horribly written, vague, and inaccurate. You need to read Ed posts to correct and clarify blatantly wrong info in the requirements\n\nPositives:\n- you will have some super chill weeks\n- course content is relatively straightforward\n- learning git is extremely helpful, but should have been more in-depth\n- you are guaranteed to get a B, but not an A; an A is achievable if you don't get screwed over by A6 or your group\n\n\n*In Depth Review*\nThis class is not quite as easy as people make it out to be, especially for those who are not strong in Java or android development. There seems to be a lot of experienced android/java developers exaggerating the lack of effort needed for this class. \n\nFor background, I have my BS in CS, and I consider myself an experienced coder, albeit I primarily code in just Python. There are weeks when you do barely any work, and other weeks you are drowning. Here's a breakdown of how the semester went for me.\n\nA1 - A3: minimal work, as things are straightforward. shouldn't be more than 4 hours a week if you watch the lecture content and read Ed posts for tips.\n\nA4: You need to code a real, but very simple android app. I personally find android development an awful, awful experience. This assignment isn't terrible, but the pain comes from setting up android studio / IntelliJ, and just slogging through the buggy/slow parts of android studio and relearning Java if you're not familiar with it. 2 hours if you're comfortable with android, upwards of 10 hours if inexperienced.\n\nA5: requirements are light, but the sheer ambiguity of it all will leave you spending more time than you might think. could spend 1 hour, could spend 5+. This is also only worth a whopping 2% of your grade, so don't pull your hair out.\n\nGroup Project Weeks 1 and 2: the first two weeks aren't too crazy, just prepping documents and planning your application. Should be about 5 hours of work max, each week.\n\nGroup Project Weeks 3 and 4: the course is poorly planned here, and expects 4-5 students of varying skill-levels to code a full-on android application. This is a hot mess and very stressful, as you're relying on 3-4 other people to somehow write code that will all work together in the span of 2 weeks. This was the most intense and stressful part of the semester, and my group was a bunch of ANGELS who were skilled, nice, and prompt. I can't imagine how bad this would be with a bad group.\n\nA6: a horrible, horrible assignment worth 15% of your grade, and many people get a grade ranging from 40-70 because of trick questions. I knew ahead of time the assignment was full of trick questions and tried my best, but still landed at a 64. If you want an A, be prepared to do well on everything else so you have leeway on the assignment. I spent about 8 hours on this assignment.\n\nIndividual Project D1: another painful part of the semester where you have to learn how to use a TSL generator, which entails learning the syntax behind laying down constraints to generate a concise set of test cases to test an application. This was not fun at all, because TSL generator syntax is hard to pin down to do exactly what you want it to do. the lecture provides a decent example, however. Then you need to write up 50-90 test cases in Java. This was 12+ hours of work.\n\nIndividual Project D2: Assuming you wrote good test cases in D1, and your test cases from TSL had decent coverage, this week is really light. I spent about 2 hours this week.\n\nIndividual Project D3: Here you just need to code basic Java programming (no android development, thank god). Depending on your Java comfortability, this could be 3 hours, could be 10+. I spent about 6 hours, a lot of which I continued to relearn java.\n\nIndividual Project D4: another quick week, you just refactor your code from D3. I spent about 3 hours. Others reported 1-2 hours.\n\nGrading: grading was fair and returned reasonably promptly... until the group project, which took about a month for them to give back, leaving you blind in where you stand academically. A6 also took about a month to get back, which sucked more with a stingingly low grade. D2, D3, and D4 all give autograder scores immediately, thankfully. Additionally, grading of the project really seemed to be based on luck. My group got a 95, but other groups with seemingly fine implementations got 60-80 range. My advice is to put together really good documents, or else they will slash points hard.\n\nOverall, this class started pleasant, had an awful middle stretch, but ended with a soft landing in the last 3 weeks. Poor assignment requirements, strict/rude TAs, and the inability to front-load work make this class unenjoyable.\n\nIn comparison to other classes, this is pretty easy and light, but by no means is it a complete walk in the park.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

I've been writing code and working various forms of SDP for 24 years now.  So this should have been easy, but too much busy work in the Group project and Individual project and an annoyingly cleaver Assignment 6 really made me walk away with the feeling of disappointment. \n\nThe group project hosted an overly annoying set of busy work with design docs, and  status deliverables.  I fell into the trap of doing all the coding work since I was the most experienced on the team and left all the docs to the lesser experienced members who in-turn didn't really do a good job and the last day was a scramble to bring the docs up to par.  But, since being a one-man show on the code, I had missed a few \"requirements\" and my teammates didn't have the wherewithal to notice or call out the missing requirements, we got an 84 overall.  But after grades were released, a  vague, overly word-smithed message was broadcasted about a mistake in grading and our grade shot up to 94.\n\nAssignment 6 was what really made me angry, first off, it had a due date exactly the same instant that the Group project was due.  Second, the instructor and TA's get together ever semester and dream up this insane set of trick questions about code coverage and whitebox testing and treat it as a great learning experience.  I got a 70 on that stupid assignment because my guard was down and I didn't realize this class engaged in such trick question tactics.   On top of that, I just completed CS6340, software analysis, prior to this.  CS6340 is a very well run, incredible class that teaches blackbox/whitebox testing properly.  This class CS6300 has no business diving into whitebox testing the way it did, I think the only reason they do is  so the TAs and professor can claim some one up on the students delivering a trick question assignment and they can unveil the actual solution in a grand office hours for all to see how cleaver and tricky they were.\n\nI think there are many more choices that could have been used as the subject of Assignment 6, oh I don't know, maybe focus on CI/CD pipelines  for example.  Just bad course material selection and most is not relevant  in the real world.",

This course really honed my Git skills, as well as strengthened my Java coding, but I didn't feel like I took a wealth of new knowledge away from this course. \n\nPros -\nProfessor Orso is fantastic, his lectures are enjoyable to watch, and he's quite active on the message board and with office hours.  TAs all pretty good too, response times were very quick.\n\nI really enjoyed the individual assignments, as I thought they were well documented and easy to understand what the objectives were.  Learned quite a bit from these.\n\nMy group was very active for the group project (albeit a little last minute on some things).  We got a solid A on the project.\n\nCons -\nWhile the lectures were enjoyable to watch, I don't feel like I retained the knowledge that well since we aren't tested directly on the material.  Sure, some of the lectures were pretty key as a demo for some of the assignments, but I felt like you could really skip most of them and just get the assignments and projects done to coast on by. \n\nThe group and individual projects were just kind of blah. There really wasn't an excitement to working on the applications needed to be developed.\n\nOverall, I am still glad I took the course, I just don't think it quite lived up to my expectations.",

First I just want to say that I do not have a CS background but am proficient in Python and Javascript and taught myself some basic Java before starting the class. If you have a similar background, you will definitely be using google a lot and these project may take you slightly longer to complete compared to others. This was the case for me, but still managed to get an A in this course pretty easily. I would recommend this to anyone starting this program or looking for an easy course to end the program with. \n\nOverall I learned a lot in this course and found the subject very interesting. I was really happy to learn how to use Git in collaboration with teammates which is a useful skill. I also liked that there are no tests or graded quizzes and MOST the lectures were pretty helpful. Orso does a good job of presenting lectures so they are actually bearable to watch.\n\nMost students complain about the group project and unfair grading. My experience was pretty positive and I felt that any points lost were fair and couldn't be argued. Based on previous feedback I was pretty nervous about Assignment 6 but surprisingly found it to be one of the easier projects. This assignment didn't involve any coding, but did require you to watch the lectures and read the questions carefully and apply some logic. Despite my experience many people seemed to lose a lot of points on this.\n\nThe individual project was a bit more challenging and the first Deliverable was the most tedious part. After that it was not so bad. Most of the Individual Project is submitted in the autograder so it was nice to see the feedback and scores for the assignments. \n\nComplaints: I think the most common complaint is about the weighting. Assignment 6 was 15% of the grade and this is where many people lost points. I think it would be a good idea to spread the percentage out over all assignments more so one assignment doesn't have such a huge impact on the score.\n\nFinal thoughts:\nIf you are looking for an easy A or have no CS background and want to improve your Git and Java skills, take this class!\nIf you are already a software engineer or have a solid CS background and you want to actually learn/challenge yourself, this may be a waste of your time.",

For the final individual project, the project is as dull as possible, and you have to implement 50-90 unit tests! It is an easier course, but there's little educational take away.",

Then me and my team showed proof of the working app and that the documentations were present. After multiple regrades and back and forth with the TAs it was regraded to 76/100 and still the grade did not justify the efforts we put in.\n\nI ended up with a final score of 89 and received my first B for the easiest course that I've taken in OMSCS. This course does not grade you for your work on the manually graded projects and relies on the mood of your TA evaluating. Worse experience!!!!",

If you're familiar with Java and OOP, I would guess that you'll be fine. If you've done software development in the past, you will more than likely be bored in this class.",

First off, prepare for a lot of unnecessary tedium, vague instructions, and shady/lack of transparent grading which is really an attempt at artificially increasing the difficulty of this course. \n\nThe 6th assignment in this class for example was extremely vague and was graded pretty harshly. Compared to the group project which had multiple deliverables and spanned over a month, assignment 6 had a one week deadline yet was worth %15 (3% less than the group project). \n\nFor Assignment 5 which was a much much simpler assignment than assignment 6 and was only worth %2 of the final grade, it literally took TAs an entire month to grade this which is completely unacceptable. \n\nNo feedback was provided each week for any of our one week deliverables for the Group Project. And it was almost a month after submitting the final project that we actually received a grade. This would have been fine if we received feedback for each deliverable, but it never happened. So between the first week of Oct and late November, we were completely left in the dark on how our project did. Only to finally get a project grade with vague, trivial and nonsensical point deductions.\n\nThe assignments which involve using Git, working with Junit   tests and using Android Studio are very helpful and have good value, especially for newer programmers. But again I'm not fan of this course's grading practices, TA attitude problems (especially on Ed) as well as how the Group Project and subsequent assignments were handled. \n\n\n\n\n",

But this course changed my mind. I'm lucky enough to be assigned into a positive group.\n\nIndividual Project:\n- Test driven development.\n- Basic I/O operations with java\n- Object Oriented Programing.\n\nOverall, I received more than I have spent on this course. By contrast, I have almost spent the same time on CS6250 CN. But I literally received nothing from CS6250 CN. Although I received an A from CS 6250 CN, the contrast of the bad learning experience of 6250 to good learning experience of 6300 are obvious due to the followings:\n- SDP designed solid projects for students to finish, in which some important concepts(such as TDD, OOD/OOP) were delivered through individual/group projects.\n- Compared with SDP, CN has much more abstract/broad concepts needed to be delivered. For 6250 CN, I even don't know which concepts should I learn, how well I've learnt from Exams/quizzes/projects.\n- SDP is different from 6250 CN. You can expect to learn some important concepts/programming methodology from SDP with reasonable efforts.\n\n**TL; DR**, reasonable positive learning experience with reasonable \n efforts.",

My group was incredible and everyone knocked their portion out of the park! There is definitely a little more work in the end of the semester but its not a ton more. I don't think there was a week I spent more than 6-8 hours ever in this course. If you are going for perfect scores on the latter assignments you might spend longer. If you are just looking to get an A, you shouldn't need a ton of time.\n\nAs for the material its good for an intro definitely. You should after this course have enough knowledge to more heavily research any of the areas covered. Would recommend pairing this course with another or taking this course a semester you know you'll be busy or need a little time to de-stress.",

For me it was useful to review git/github, software testing, and java basics, but for someone with a lot of experience in those areas it might be too simple.\n- Enjoyed the assignments with the exception of the group project.\n- No exams and almost no reading. Only a small amount of writing required to produce documents for the group project.\n- Many assignments have an auto-grader so you can get your grade right away and can make changes to your work as necessary.\n- Probably a light enough work load that this class could be paired with another class\n\nCons:\n- I got a less than stellar group for the group project and it was very frustrating to feel like I was working on my own for long periods of time. On the up-side, at least the group project counts for a small enough part of your grade that as long as you don't bomb it completely, you can probably pull off an A in the class based on your individual assignments. If you're worried about getting a bad group and want to prepare for doing the group project on your own, my advice is to learn as much about Android studio and building Android apps as you can. Learn how to make a responsive layout and how to persist data in a database with the Room library and you can probably crank out the whole project in less than 20 hours a week.\n- Professor and TAs repeatedly discouraged asking questions. I understand that it's frustrating when students ask questions they could answer by reading the assignment or by googling, but one of the main reasons I'm part of this program is to participate in discussions with students, TAs, and professors. Telling students repeatedly that they should not be asking questions isn't a great way to encourage collaborative learning.\n- Grades take forever to come back for assignments that aren't auto-graded so it's hard to tell how you're doing in the class.",

I probably spent less than 10 hours on this class until A5. Once the group project started the amount of time increased. My group went with Kotlin for the android app. I rather liked the group project. Although everything after the group project I really hated. A6 really leaves a bad taste in my mouth. I understand the concept needs to be taught in this class, but 15% for this bs man come on. Why make A6 the make it or break it assignment? It is way to easy to bomb just one of the 5 questions on this assignment to tank your grade. The individual project is especially annoying. D1 TSL generator really sucks. Someone in EdTech should make this a project to replace this with a GUI. So, if you are going to take EdTech in the future please do this and save future students! So, D2 is making unit tests against the instructor\u2019s program. I would plan to not get 100 percent on this assignment unless you have hours and hours of time. Getting an 85 \u2013 95 on D2 is easily in the realm of possibility. D3 is actually making the program. Same deal as D2 though plan to not get 100 on this. I would say returns start diminishing at the 90 percent range. \n",

Watch out for those people; don't hire them.\n\nIf you are a competent, capable professional, you will still get something out of this class, and yes, you will likely get an A (grades are not out yet, but that is my expectation as well).\n\nYou will have to contend with the usual band of people who begin an assignment 8 hours before it's due and ask questions indicating that they haven't even read the instructions yet, and with the \"what does main() do, newbie programmer here\" crowd. How these people can look themselves in the mirror if they eek out a degree and claim to be \"masters\" in computer science, or why GT lets them in to begin with, is beyond me. But I digress.\n\nDr. Orso and TAs are helpful. Instructions are clear, if only people would read them. The quality of the lectures is pretty good as well. There is a group project, but if you are a quality software engineer, or seeking to become one, then any shortcomings in your group can be reconciled.\n\nThe individual project was extremely helpful in solidifying how to achieve good test coverage, without an explosion of test cases which become impossible to maintain.\n\nIn short: it's one of the few options for actually exploring software engineering in OMSCS, and it's a worthwhile class to take, even if you've been in the industry for some time. If you can code (surely you can--you're in grad school, aren't you?), are studious, know how to read and follow directions, and can work effectively with others, then you will have no problems in this class.",

I got an A very easily.\n\nSomething to watch is that it's backloaded: I spent maybe a half hour per week on this class until the last few assignments where I spent a large amount of time.\n\nBe careful of A6/The individual project. Together they make up almost 40% of your grade and all happen in the last few weeks, and they're not straightforward. A6 in particular: learn what a nested if statement is (note: an if/elseif is considered a nested if statement). Many students bombed this assignment because of that misunderstanding and lost a letter grade.\n\nThe individual project has 4 parts. The latter 3 parts are autograded in gradescope. The first part uses an outdated test case creator. This first part is where students lost the bulk of their points. I spent quite some time on it and got only a ~40% (not enough to hurt my grade). The professors make it seem like if you give it a good effort and learn to use the tool you'll get full marks, but they're looking for you to check specific test cases/scenarios, so be aware.\n\nRegarding the content: I honestly didn't really care about it because I just needed a second class and want to graduate. I'm also a software engineer so I didn't really learn anything all that valuable other than the idea of path/branch/statement coverage which was an interesting thought experiment.\n\nOverall, very easy but don't sleep on the last few assignments and make sure you read the directions carefully.",

A lot of it is common sense but the application of those concepts was well-honed in assignments, however tedious they might seem.\n- Professors and TAs are pretty active / willing to answer questions on Piazza\n- Assignments are auto-graded/pretty straightforward \n- No exams\n- Material is pretty easy to understand\n\nCons:\n- Assignments are tedious at times (cost of trying to enforce concept understanding)\n- Material is pretty derivative if you are doing software engineering fulltime. To be perfectly honest, I barely had to expend much effort on this class and only spent time on the projects/assignments maybe 1-2 days before they were due.\n- Last few assignments are pretty big in terms of weighting/work and takes a bit to get graded.\n- Does not seem suited for people that are looking for hand-holding when it comes to programming problems. Be able to google issues for yourself and definitely be familiar with Java!\n\n\nIf you have a few years of software dev under your belt and looking to double up classes, this will be your best bet. I doubled up with another class this semester and had very few issues. Definitely the easiest class I've taken so far."

I wouldn't slack on these because the end of the course is the most difficult and is most of your grade. A5 is pretty straight forward if you put effort into it. \n\nGroup Project: I was lucky with my team and we were evenly placed based on experience. The group project and A4 are android apps. I enjoyed this because I have never built an android app before. My team put the work in and received 100%. \n\nA6: A6 was challenging, you will learn white box testing in depth by the end of it. No auto-grader for this one, and we still don't have the grades. This is weighted heavily. \n\nIndividual Project: This was interesting.... and tedious. Learned a lot about test driven development but it was just a pain submitting to the auto grader a million times to see if you got the coverage you needed. Besides deliverable 1, you will know your scores. 4 deliverables total. \n\nPros:\n- Very active professor and TA \n- Easy for experienced developers \n- Most assignments are auto-graded, so you know your score and can re-submit until you get the score you want.\n- No exams\n- The slack is active \n\nCons:\n- The last three assignments are more than half your grade. \n- Grading takes awhile to return unless its the autograder.\n",

                        "body": "Overall, this class was a good one.\n\nThe pros:\n\n- Professor active on Piazza, unlike many other classes in the program.\n- Professor acknowledges students who are always helping others in Piazza. It's probably the class where I saw the most students with a instructor-endorsed answerer badge in Piazza.\n- Videos are watchable: to the point and not boring, though the topics are a little outdated if compared to modern industry standards.\n- Many hands-on assignments that required coding, though the level of the challenge isn't that high for those with experience in the industry. This is understandable because it's an academic class and it does not expect students to have prior experience in professional software development. Therefore, if you have some experience, the class might not challenge you much.\n- Most of assignments are autograded, so it removes part of the anxiety in waiting for manual grading.\n- Group project is interesting.\n\nThe cons:\n\n- Content is not very relevant to modern industry development. There are relevant parts like agile methodology, design patterns and refactoring though.\n- Group project, like in any class in the program, can be hit or miss. I had a bad group and ended up doing the bulk of the work (5000+ Loc). However, I didn't know any Android development prior to the class and it was a good opportunity to get some experience with it. A con is that most of the Android resources are in Kotlin nowadays, but the project required Java, unless your entire team agree on Kotlin. \n- Not a fault of the class, but many students don't appear to be comfortable with Java or basic programming and flood Piazza with really trivial questions, most easily answerable by a 30-second Google search or a bit more tinkering. With that, Piazza often becomes bloated, hard to navigate and find the golden nuggets.\n- The individual project is bad. This is particularly bad because it's how the course ends, therefore it has the bigger impact in the students impression of the course quality. What makes the individual project bad is that most of the deliverables are not challenging in a good way. For example, in week 2 we had to create test cases for a command line application that we didn't have access to. To earn points, though, those tests had to cover the same things as the instructor's hidden tests. I came up with a lot of different tests that the instructors hadn't thought about, but wasn't rewarded by that. Moreover, getting, let's say, 85% of the total points was pretty easy, but to get 100% it required 10x or more the time invested, but this time spent wouldn't necessarily translate into learning since it's a brute-force find-the-hidden-tests endeavor.\n- There was one TA who probably oversees the individual project, but I don't remember seeing the other TAs on Piazza the entire semester. Maybe in a thread or two. They probably help the most with grading, but it would be nice to have a more balanced presence on Piazza since most of the instructor answers are always by Prof. Orso.\n- Manual grading of some assignments can take a long time. It didn't bother me, but some students were anxious about it.\n\nOverall, it's a good class, just set your expectations appropriately and be flexible.",

The professor is one of the best (in my experience the best after 5 courses) in terms of involvement. He is always in office hours, resolves one by one all the questions and he is very active on Piazza, even providing answers to follow-up questions.\n\nThis class is the perfect example of a class that can be easy but you will enjoy and actually learn by doing the assignments. For example, I worked before in testing and verification, but in this class, I realized that some of the concepts in this area were not so clear as I thought. In one of the assignments related to white-box testing the assignment looked easy, the coding was minimal, but I had to think a lot to make sure I was applying the concepts correctly.\n\nAlso, contrary to what I initially thought, the group project was highly satisfying, maybe I was lucky, but the instructions were very clear and allowed the group to organize very well to plan, design, and implement a small project. In the end, all the members felt this was the best group of our career (XD).\n\nNow, I could imagine that if you already took several courses related to testing, SW design, arch, and continuous integration tools, you might feel that the course will be basic for you. My experience comes from EE background, but somebody from the group was also a CS minor and she also enjoyed the course.\n\nHaving said that, I would say this is the perfect class to take after burning out a course (like ML) or to pair with another low demanding (something in the range of 10-12hrs). Actually, one of my group partners took it with GA and he still was very active in the group, but I guess it depends on the workload that you can take and experience.\n\nfinally, I highly recommend this class in terms of usefulness, low-moderate workload, and organization.\n\n\n",

The material is taught like they got some sense instead of encrypted with meaningless unrelated assignments like in every other class. The instructor responds to every single student Piazza post. Again, this is the only class where that happens. There are no exams. Exams are the absolute worst thing in the world. Me and one other person put a lot of effort into the group project and seeing our code mature into a beautiful butterfly was a wonderful experience. The other two group members performed like I would expect from average students: they do one or two things and let you do the rest. And I absolutely loved it this time.

The lectures are pretty straightforward, there are no tests, and the assignments for the most part can be completed by noon on the morning they come out. \n\nIf you already work with software and your goal is to only take classes where everything will be new material, then yes this class is not for you. However, if you accept that you may already know a lot of the material, it can be a nice refresher and you can probably still learn some in terms of fine-grained design and testing. And honestly most of us have probably had a stressful enough time with grad school and work that this is a nice break. \n\n## Major Pros: \n* The professor is amazing. He is very active with the class and extremely reasonable. He responded to and made changes based on classmates requests. \n* Easy to be paired with another class, or to be taken a semester when you're short on time or need a break.\n* The assignments are not released until a week before they are due. I know, this can seem annoying for those that like to work ahead and I was concerned about it myself. It actually turned out to be pretty nice. You just did the work assigned (usually in very little time) as it came out and then were free until the next week.\n* *Most* assignments are auto-graded with unlimited submissions.\n\n## Undetermined Sentiment:\n* There is a group project and groups are assigned by the professor. The project went pretty well for my group and the application was pretty simple, this will obviously vary based on your luck. I think its always cool to learn different styles from other people, which is a positive. \n* The assignments are very simple at the beginning and are a bit more heavy after the group project. Just don't be shocked by the sudden increase in workload, its still not bad though, just more in comparison to the start. \n\n\nOverall: Pretty chill class with a great professor. Try to learn something, even if you know everything.\n",

I won't go too much into the details since they are provided in other reviews, and in Fall 2020, the structure of the class has not changed from previous reviews. \n\n### The Good\n\nCourse organization: Each week had a deliverable. Although I liked this, some students did not due to personal time constraints, so keep that in mind when deciding to take the course. For me, this kept the course pace moderate, and I never felt overwhelmed. The assignments have been tailored to be completed in the time frame provided. The first few assignments are a type of sanity check to make sure you are ready for the course, which I think is a great idea. If you can complete Assignments 3 and 4 without issue, you'll be fine. The write-ups for the assignments were well done, and any clarification was answered swiftly by Dr. Orso.\n\nProfessor Participation: I have never seen a professor that is as involved in their course than Dr. Orso. He held weekly office hours as well, and I am relatively certain he answered every post on Piazza personally. \n\n\n### The Bad\n\nCourse content: This is highly subjective and really depends on how much experience you have and what your goals are coming into the class. For myself, the course was somewhat unexciting. I enjoyed the Android programming assignments, but not much else. For someone that has little experience in development, this class may offer more satisfaction, but for any experienced developers, I feel you will have the same opinion as myself.\n\n\nThe group project is difficult for me to categorize as good or bad. I don't mind group projects so much, but depending on your group, it could be a chore. In the worst case scenario, I think you could complete it by yourself.\n\nThe individual project is a bit of a chore. The second part of the project was the worst for me, which involved writing test cases to test certain scenarios for the application you are charged with writing. This was mostly a guess and check assignment, and to me did not facilitate learning anything.\n\n\nI had somewhat corrupt reasons for taking this course. My main goal was to find a class that I could pair with a more difficult course, and it definitely succeeded in that regard. I don't feel it is fair to rate the class negatively for this reason. This course has the goal of teaching Software Development methods, and in that regard it succeeds. The class is fine, but I wasn't excited to complete assignments or anything, and really did not learn much. ",

There is some good *topics* in the course, but I don't think the material is handled well enough for me to say that the *content* is particularly good. That is to say, if I just had the syllabus and read about the topics I wasn't already familiar with on my own, I would be no worse off.\n\n(1) I found much of the \"Software Dev Process\" content was never connected to how actual code is written. So today I'm just as good or bad of a developer as I was before this course. To make use of anything covered in the class will take quite a bit more work. At best, right now I'm at a place where I know there are a bunch of design diagrams that I could make for future projects. Will I...? No, I would still need to learn a lot more about converting schematics into code for it to be worth my time.\n\n(2) I spent a lot of time getting Android Studio to work properly. I strongly suggest testing both IntelliJ and Android Studio right away to the specifications stated by the class.\n\n(3) About 35% of the class will revolve around using Android Studio to develop apps. On the one hand, these weeks had assignments that were more straight-forward compared to the rest. However, I personally have no need for app development so it was a lot of time spent learning things I won't use.\n\n(4) The professor is very active on Piazza. It's great for when assignments need to be corrected, which happens often, but is understandable and thus appreciated. But they very actively discourage discussing anything about anything in detail. That is, don't expect any practical answers by anyone on the forum apart from assignment corrections. This is my biggest distaste for the OMSCS program in general; it's always a struggle to figure out what is \"appropriate\" to talk about in each class. So much so that often times I find it easier to just not bother asking at all even if I was genuinely curious to begin with. I understand the impetus to prevent cheating, but this is grad school, as in, the value of grades is dwarfed by the prospect of actually learning something. But in these OMSCS classes, we often hamstring the latter for fear of degrading the sanctity of the former.\n\nIf you have use for an easy A or a light survey course on Software Dev Process, take this class. I am glad I did for both those reasons. But don't expect anything else.",

                        "body": "This was my third course in the OMSCS program.  I have almost a decade and a half of software development experience.  Reviews prior to taking this class led me to think it would be along the same lines as my undergraduate Software Engineering course.  This was pretty spot-on.  While the class focuses a lot on the overall process, documentation, and design aspects, there were some useful takeaways for me.  It is an entirely project-based course, which means no exams.  Various assignments made me more familiar and comfortable with Git, Java, and Android development.  The professor is very involved in both the office hours and on Piazza.  The TAs were pretty good and responsive.  If you have any software development experience, I wouldn't expect too much from taking this course.  Some of the individual projects were challenging and confusing, and the team project comes with the standard \"have good teammates\" statement.  If you are new to software development or just need an easy course, this is a great one, especially for a summer course.\n\n### Assignments\n- **Assignment 1 (2%)**: This is a survey used for forming teams.  You are not able to request teammates.\n- **Assignment 2 (5%)**: This is a simple assignment on getting familiar with Git.  It can be knocked out quickly if you follow the instructions exactly.  It is all command-line based.  You can use a GUI later on, but you must/should use the command-line for this assignment.\n- **Assignment 3 (10%)**: This assignment is a quick introduction to Java coding and JUnit tests.\n- **Assignment 4 (10%)**: This assignment walks you through creating an Android application.  It is great if you haven't done Android development before.\n- **Assignment 5 (20%)**: This assignment focuses on white-box testing.  You definitely need to understand branch, path, and code coverage.\n- **Group Project** (15%): There are four deliverables for the team project.  The first is mostly design documentation (UML Class Diagram and reasoning).  The second is updated design documents (project plan, use cases, and test plan).  The third is revised documents, a user manual, and a prototype of the Android application.  The last is the completed Android application and updated documentation.\n- **Collaboration** (10%): This is labeled as collaboration, but it is purely an evaluation of your teammates work on the group project.\n- **Individual Project (25%)**: There are three deliverables.  The project focuses a lot on black box testing by creating test cases and developing an application conforming to those tests.\n- **Participation (3%)**: These are easy points.  This is watching all the lectures and doing all the checkpoint quizzes within the lectures.\n\n### Take-Aways\n- **Miscellaneous Stuff**: Do the assignments.  Most of them are easy, fun, quick to complete, and straight-forward.  The instructor and TAs are helpful and very proactive in Office Hours and Piazza.  Start assignments early.  They may not take long, but it gives you more time at the end of the week to relax or fix any mistakes.\n- **Textbook**: There is no textbook or reference material for this course.\n- **Team Project**: You can't pick teammates, so you are at the mercy of the TAs as to who will be on your team.  They use the results from A0 to create the teams.  I am in EST.  One teammate was also in EST, but the other 2 were in PST.  This made it a challenge at times to get together to work on the project.  While a project manager is not required, have someone in charge who truly understands software development.  I feel I had the most experience on our team, but the person who took the lead probably had the least amount.  It made the project fun.  I felt there were parts of this project not really required, but I understand they were put in to understand the overall development process.  Some of the documents required were not completely clear on what they wanted, but they were easy to figure out.  The application itself was easy to complete.  DO NOT OVER COMPLICATE IT.  Our team lead insisted on a crap ton of branches and pull requests, to the extent of it making it a mess when it came time to merge and submit.  Keep it simple and knock it out early.  Worst case, it is a small enough project for 1 or 2 people to do by themselves.\n- **Individual Project**:  This was a pain in the rear.  Deliverable 1 gave you a Linux command with command-line options.  You had to use the TSL category partition test frames to create 30-60 JUnit tests.  It is very easy to get a low grade on this deliverable if you do not fully understand the task.  I calculated my grade to be around a 50 on this deliverable.  Furthermore, if you get started on the 30-60 test cases and realize you didn't capture a possibility, there was the likelihood you would have to redo (or at least review) the cases you already created.  This happened to me several times.  D2 had you possibly revising test cases.  You ran the test cases you created against a sample implementation of the Linux command.  As extra credit, you could implement the command, but it had to pass your test cases as well as unknown test cases created by the instructor.  My grade on D2 was 109.78 out of 100 because I couldn't figure out how to handle 2 of the instructor's unknown test cases from the error results.  If you did the extra credit on D2, you had a large portion of D3 done as it required the implementation of the Linux command.  You also had an option for extra credit by providing more test cases to pass your implementation as well as the instructors.  On D3, I received 110 out of 100.  Deliverable 1 is definitely the hardest.  Even with good scores on D2 and D3, I still received a 89.64 for the overall individual project score.\n- **Exams**:  No exams made it more worthwhile and focused toward the process.\n- **Professor and TAs**: Dr. Orso made the class interesting and engaging.  Will Johnson, who was also a TA in DB, was great.  There were a couple of TAs that never appeared in Piazza or Office Hours.  I was afraid I was going to be bored to death in this class, but Dr. Orso's involvement and understanding in the course made it much more enjoyable.  Also, I have never seen a professor more involved in the Office Hours or responsive to emails or Piazza posts.  If you had a question, he was more likely to answer it quicker than a TA or student.  I feel this class was made much better than I expected purely because of the instructional staff.\n- **Overall Grade**: I feel like I put an acceptable amount of time in this course for it being over the summer.  I also feel I played a large part in the team project.  I received 100s on A1-A4.  A5 was a challenge at 68.33.  Only a final grade is given for the team project, which was 97.5.  The individual project was a true pain.  Deliverable 1 was about a 49, D2 was 109.78, and D3 was 110, giving me a 89.64 on my individual project.  In the end, I received an A in the course with a score of 90.7.  Some of the weights are a little heavy, but this is probably due to the 5 assignments over the summer compared to 7 during the fall or spring.  A lot of students had issues with a low score on A5 and A5 being worth 20% of our grade.\n\n# TLDR\nIn short, if you have had a software development course and/or experience, this class may be a waste of time; however, if you are needing an easy grade or refresher, this class may fit the bill.  For me, I feel the summer is the perfect time for this course; however, if you want to take it during the spring or fall, you should be able to easily double it up with another course.  The material could be updated a little.  The instructor and head TAs are great.  Over the last year in the program, I have read the reviews.  As a result, I encourage you to read some of the other reviews for the course.  Many of them, this course included, aren't far off from the truth.",

Programming tasks deal with relatively simple things like string management and test cases. This course is ideal for a summer semester because of its low stress level.\n+ Professor Orso is extraordinarily responsive and thorough on Piazza. I thought Joyner's classes were organized, but Orso gives him a run for his money. You definitely don't have to worry about getting messed up because of a problem in the course content.\n+ The individual project is somewhat fun. You end up having to reverse-engineer some text-handling code and write test cases for it. I liked it because I have little experience in Java (the language for most of the assignments), so I learned a little there.\n+ The lecture videos are a bit dry, but they don't waste your time much. I didn't mind watching them. Because there are no exams, there's no need to take detailed notes, so it's more relaxing.\n\nCons:\n- This course has a strict assignment release and due date schedule. Assignments are only released the week they're due, and if you finish early, you just have to twiddle your thumbs while you wait. In another course, this could be a major problem, but since the assignments were never too time-consuming, it ended up being okay. Still not preferable.\n- There is a group project. Simply having a group project is a significant negative, since you never know who you'll end up with, and there's no option to just do it by yourself. I got lucky and got a decent group, but I'm sure some people weren't so lucky.\n- The previously mentioned group project is designing an Android app. That's kind of a pro for me, since I've never done something like that, but it ended up being a con since Android Studio was unbelievably slow and hard to develop in for me (maybe a problem with my machine?). I also thought it was kind of a shotgun blast of new info that I'll never use again, so not much stuck.\n\nOverall, this is a low-stress course where you probably won't have any eureka moments, but it's good for strengthening your foundations and perhaps exposing yourself to Java and Android. It's perfect for a summer semester or pairing with another course.",

                        "body": "I think this course should be taken in a Spring or Fall semester, but if you are willing to put in the work during the summer, it will be a little hecktick but is doable. I took it in summer and this class is perfect foundation. Only drawback is that you will have one of the highest grade valued assignments (and riskier ones as well) due at the same time of your team project. That caused me to have 2 deadlines at the same time. I had only the weekend for that assignment. I didn't do well and that cause my grade to go down. I would like to say this would'nt happen during spring or fall, I think this could be avoided but maybe is an experiment to see what students do, since that is how real life in the SDLC things would occur.  Now there is also an Individual Project worth more that the team project, and is also very tough.\n\nOther than that. the course is excellent. I am a black box tester for a living, and I got benefits from this class. I learned Java coding, Intellij IDE (which is awesome!), Java's JUnit 4 for unit testing your code,  Android development in Java (some people I heard that coded in Kotlin which worked fine cause you can convert to Java so that is an additional skill you might learn), I also touched Espresso to create an automated test suite for Android, I also learned SQLite in Java for android, Git/Github in a team setting, plus all the formal documents for delivering and shippoing a project: Design, Project, Test PLan, and architecting the project using Lucidchar by creating UML diagrams, etc\n\nMore in git, I also beefed up on GIT/Github but collaborating with multiple team members all coding on the same files as you is very different from just you modifying a codebase on your own. So found myself using squash, cherry picking, and addressing rebase in both local repo and remote repo.\n\nThe professor is super active, and the TA team was excellent, Kudos to Q. He was active in both Piazza and Slack. I learned a lot. I just wish Assignment 5 was not worth that much. \n\nHave to say this class is not easy but is worth taking for the skills you will get.",

Most of the negative reviews seem to be from people who didn't read the reviews and expected this course to be something it isn't. For someone like me with no software development experience, and who also didn't major in CS in undergrad, I learned a few basic/useful things. I had a decent team for the group project and I feel I learned from it. I learned some Android basics and brushed up on my Java basics. I also learned some basic terminology and SDP concepts and I feel less clueless about those now. Some people complained that Assignment #5 was worth too much of the grade (20%) but honestly just be warned that you need to triple check your logic on that assignment and it's not tricky. The professor was very involved in the course on Piazza. Overall worth taking if you don't already know the material.",

You'll learn the basics of git, UML diagrams, and the software development process.   The group project can easily be done by one person as well. My team was good and I did 99% of our back-end while others handled most of the UI and documentation.\n\nThe instructor, Alex Orso, is awesome though, and the only reason I didn't give this class a strong dislike here. He's very active on Piazza, admits when the autograder is having issues, and is very enthusiastic about teaching. The only thing that irked me is that he releases assignments on a Saturday morning which makes exactly zero sense. Just release on Monday and give people the weekend they want, most of us work full time! But anyways, if you can write code, you'll probably get it done on a lax work evening.\n\nI regret not pairing this class with something else.",

Grades take sometime to be released. I have learned a lot from this course. I strongly recommend it and you can get an easy A on this course if you put sometime into it.   ",

Even if you have no Java experience, it should be relatively straightforward. As others have mentioned, there are no tests and the Group Project can be done by yourself, if you absolutely have to. I found the introduction to making Android applications really engaging and interesting. If you have no Java experience, I suppose it's a fine introduction to Java.\n\nHowever, the way the class is run and graded makes this course significantly worse than it could be.\n\n1 - The grading times are LONG! On average, it took us a month to get an assignment returned to us. Some assignments took a lot longer. 3 days after the last assignment was due, I still had 40% of my grade missing. I find this unacceptable. If you can't grade the assignments in a reasonable amount of time, get more TAs or simplify your assignments to allow them to be autograded.\n\n2 - The TAs refused to give us grading criteria or a rubric. Whenever they were asked, they would respond as though the grading was obvious, but providing a simple rubric for each assignment would have reduced the Piazza forum questions by about half.\n\n3 - The TAs were inactive on Piazza, and when they were there is was generally to answer easy questions that the students had already answered for them (quoting assignment or syllabus text to the person asking). If you had a more difficult question - crickets until a day before the assignment was due.\n\n4 - HW assignments were released Saturday morning and have them due Friday night. I don't know why they couldn't have just overlapped them so you always had two weekends if you needed it. They said this was because the TAs could better respond during the week, except they never responded anyway and everyone worked on it over the weekends (obviously...) and there was little clarification or involvement from the TAs. This meant I was finishing my HW on Saturday then hanging around following the convolution of Piazza threads for the rest of the week and then frantically adjusting my HW come Thursday or Friday.\n\n5 - The grading weights make no sense. A group project that takes about 60hrs over the course of 4 weeks was worth 20% of my grade. A simple Java application that I wrote in 2 hours is worth 15%. \n\n6 - As a general course feedback note, for all classes really, PLEASE ORGANIZE YOUR PIAZZA THREADS! Man, forum posts get so out of hand so quickly. All it takes to make it easier to follow is to create a dedicated HW1 thread, or a dedicated HW2 thread...Then students only have to follow one thread and it's far easier to see what has already been asked.\n\nAll in all, I soured on this class really fast. I thought the assignments were super contrived and convoluted, and I thought the grading policy was intentionally opaque to try and milk students for points. \nWorst OMSCS experience to date.\n\n",

Deliverable 3 of the project asks to write test cases to cover 100% of the classes which are invisible to us. It made me like a robot when I spent several hours on trying all the combinations to achieve the goal. What is worse, the whole course is ambiguous. The descriptions of assignments are ambiguous. Most of topics in piazza are discussing the meaning of assignments. The TA (if not a forum mediator)'s answers are ambiguous. For example, a student's test cases cover 98% of the main class and he/she wants to know the weight of the other 2%. \"You can get partial score\". Do you think this kind of answer helpful? The comments of assignments are always ambiguous. I got one line comment for most of assignments even I lost lots of points. I have to say this is the worst course I have taken from this program.",

The TA's were also very good and were helpful with clarifying assignment instructions.\n\nThe course had 7 Java coding (or mostly coding) assignments, 1 individual project and 1 group project. The group project can be good or bad depending on the team, but it could be done by one person in a pinch. This project is more about documentation than it is coding, so make sure to document everything exactly as it is described.",

The lectures were pretty good and made me reconsider some things about my job.  The professor is great!  Piazza was a bit crowded with people asking questions that had already been asked several times, so I started ignoring it.  The workload wasn't too bad, even for the summer.  My group was very proactive so we met more than once a week and we did pretty well on the assignments.\n\nUnfortunately, I had taken the Software Engineering course 6310 before this course.  They are extremely similar, and so I felt like I had already learned about 70% of the material.  That being said, I wish I had taken this class first, since I liked it a lot better.  SE is focused on UML diagrams.  SD is focused on the process of creating good code more than its structure.  I feel like that was a much more useful approach as a software engineer.  So I'd recommend taking this class and skipping SE.",

While the groups are set up such that you will have one expert on your team, each team member will be able to contribute.  The project is meant to teach the Agile development process including test driven development.  I was not thrilled with the emphasis of using the TSL generated tests, but understand why they would want to teach a formal method.  The instructor and TA's were great with responses and support for such a large course.   My main complaints are the lag in feedback (grades) considering the individual projects are cumulative and the summer schedule is not balanced well.  One week we had two major deliverables due (one group, one individual).   You can't really work ahead either.  Still, a valuable course for any non-professional Android programmer.",

Also learn basic regular expression and Java matcher APIs. Besides A7 (white box testing), I found all other assignments to be quite straight forward. There were 7 individual assignments, one group project, and one individual project. Assignments 5, 6, and 7 takes makes up majority of the assignment grades percentage wise. \n\nGroup project grading is strict, so pay very close attention to the project description (and the deliverables for each week). Group members are randomly selected. I unfortunately ended up in a bad group. However, the group project is basically a simple android app (ended up writing around 4k lines of code total). One person can do the project by themselves but it will be quite a bit of work.\n\nThe individual project was very simple. It did not take much time.\n\nDuring the summer term, the load is a bit higher due to having multiple deliverables during the same week. There is something due every week besides the first week and the last week of classes. So if you are planning to take it during the summer, make sure you are very comfortable in Java, Regular Expressions, UML (class diagram, use cases, sequence diagram), jUnit, and Android app development (especially dynamic UI content generation, persistence via SQLite or Room).

The class is pretty popular because it's required for the Interactive Intelligence specialization, but it doesn't teach a lot of good software engineering principles, in my opinion. The way test-driven development is explained and required in assignments is a bit bad, so I recommend you don't take the class recommendations blindly. The video lessons are actually decent, but the principles aren't implemented soundly in the assignments, the rubrics are often subjective, and grading is painfully slow. But the pace of the course, with weekly assignments and a group project, makes it hard to front load and/or handle the projects in a way you see fit.\n\nRecommendation: if you've already got some software development experience and you're not doing the II specialization, skip this class. \nIf you've got zero software development experience (e.g. you're switching careers), this can actually be useful despite its shortcomings, but in that case a) make sure to learn some Java beforehand and b) don't take the class during the summer, because the schedule can be challenging for a newbie.",

                        "body": "Took CS6300 in Summer 2019. I think because of the shortened 11-week summer semester, there were some time crunch weeks where you would have both a HW assignment due along with a non-trivial Group Project deliverable (weeks 7 and 8). Whereas in a regular 16-week Spring or Fall semester, those would be spread out so there would only be one HW assignment or one Group Project deliverable. Also the Summer Individual Project Deliverables 2 and 3 are crammed into one week, albeit with the combined Deliverable 2 and 3 abbreviated a bit compared to the Deliverables 2 and 3 on separate weeks in the regular semester editions.\n\nOther than that, having a good group will help a lot (but your group is chosen by the TAs to take into account experience/skillsets/time zones so all you can do is cross your fingers). \n\nYou can't work ahead because the HW assignments and Project Deliverables are released on Saturday morning and due the next Saturday morning (if you are in a US time zone). So forget about taking a vacation from mid-May to late-July, especially if you are also working full-time. \n\nI did well (ended up with over a 100% in the class due to some small extra credit in the Individual Project), but this class took more time that I thought it would (a little over 14 hours a week) because I was in charge of releasing the deliverables for my group and am sort of a perfectionist. I have a little Java/C++ programming background, but that was mainly in an academic setting back in college (never professional) a long time ago in a galaxy far far away. So to be honest, I forgot most of it. I had to pick up Java and OOP real fast and needed to spend a little more time working out how to use Intellij and Android Studio. It wasn't that hard, but I did work as an engineer in a professional setting coding logic in other languages. \n\nI had a pretty fast computer -- recent Core-i7 desktop class CPU, with 32GB ram and a PCIe SSD running Ubuntu Linux, so using Android Studio to run various on-screen Android smartphone emulators was pretty fast and smooth for me (took about 4-5 seconds to start up an emulator to the home screen), so I didn't have to sideload our group app to my smartphone to test it. I'm not sure how long it takes for people on \"regular\" laptops to startup and load an Android emulator from Android Studio. I just sideloaded the app in the end to make some final QA checks; and that was pretty cool to see your Android smartphone running a crypto text game successfully and not crashing =) \n\nAll-in-all, a fun class, but one that took more time than I anticipated for the summer. I got some good value from the class, but I'm not a grizzled SW engineer much less a SW engineer at all. This class is more backloaded in terms of work in the summer -- the first assignment is just a team matching survey, following by 2 coding assignments (git repo manipulation through the command line and Basic Java coding). Each can be done in a weekend afternoon or less (maybe 2 weekend afternoons for the Basic Java coding). But the Android app assignment (week 4), the final Android Deliverable (week 9), and the Individual Project Deliverable 1 and 2 (weeks 10 and 11), I spent anywhere from 14-20 hours working on it for that week. \n\nThe only thing that you could work ahead in is the final group Android app deliverable, but considering how much it is worth (15% for the actual project, 10% for how your partners rated your work) and how it is graded, your time might be better spent just hitting the requirements and not endless optimization of the app and the layout/appearance of some button. More value is put on thorough documentation, hitting all the requirements/specs, and the thought behind the software design process rather than an aesthetically pleasing, 100% clean, efficient and corner-case bug free program.",

It will literally save you tens of hours, which, if you value your time, is worth spending a little money on if you have to. If you already have a CS degree or experience in the field, it might not be as enlightening and your time is probably better spent elsewhere (unless you just want to take an easy course).

There is one group project, so hope you get a half decent group. Half my members were competent which was good enough to do well I think.",

This course can be paired with another.\n\nOverall, I didn't walk away feeling inspired or wow'd, but the course met its objectives and dips into app development and Java which can be interesting if you've never touched them before.",

The lectures were decent though if you've worked in software development, they probably hit on much you already know or have heard before. The forums were active and helpful. There's a month long group project which I would suspect could make or break your enjoyment of this course. I had a great team and the project was fun so I enjoyed the course. Many of the assignments and the individual project are pretty abstract and a bit boring but also pretty easy if you're an experienced programmer. If not, this would be a great course to gain some skills in that arena. My main complaint was grading and feedback. The grading was very slow and feedback usually wasn't very helpful and it usually came so long after the due date (around 1 month) it'd be hard to remember what they were talking about even if it was more detailed. And the fact that many assignments built on one another makes the slow grading even more of an issue. I think the individual TAs seemed good but maybe they didn't have enough of them to effectively manage the workload. Professor Orso was great, very involved and clearly enthusiastic about the subject matter.",

The class projects were pretty simple and straightfoward, but there is a deliverable every week so it can feel overwhelming if you've got a ton of other stuff going on. There is a group project where you can work with 2-3 other people. Overall, I had a good time with this class, and really enjoyed it. I appreciate the exposure and experience considering my non-CS background.\n\nThe professor is very active in this course, which was refreshing compared to the other classes I've taken. The lectures are also much more interesting to watch as the professor is quite quirky. I **do** think if you're someone who is already a veteran in software development, you might find this class to be non-value-added. Otherwise, this is a fun class and an easy A, as long as you keep up with the work.\n\nMy only critique is that the largest (and hardest) portion of this group project was essentially the programming part (we had to create XML layouts and design an Android app)--but the overall grade was focused equally with the other parts of the project, which was mostly documentation. I can't confirm the exact division of points, but there were 4 deliverables, and 3 out of the 4 were documentation related. It definitely felt like 75% of the grade was paperwork, but only 25% was the programming (which was honestly the hardest/lengthiest part!). My group was pretty hardworking and we actually put a lot of hours into the programming part. We managed to get a fully functionally app... But we got ding'd for some misunderstanding of how to present the documentation, so that was a bummer. Word of advice, make sure you hassle the class/TA's for clarification for everything that sounds ambiguous--I swear, sometimes it feels like they do it on purpose to trick you! The group project was worth 15%, than another 10% was the collaboration grade which was based on how the group rated each other. So in total, the group project is a quarter of your overall grade. Anyway, this is from my personal experience since I really lucked out with an amazing group, but I can see that the distribution of points is likely more than fair since the instructors want to account for cases where folks get a bad group.",

                        "body": "I took this course as a less work intensive course to pair with a very high workload course. It worked out well. The course is not very demanding but there is something due every single week of the semester on Fridays. So be prepared to have to dedicate 5-10 hours every week of a 16 week semester to an assignment/project. Since I don't come from a traditional CS or software engineering background the course content was somewhat interesting and entirely new to me. However, if you're already an experienced software engineer by trade I doubt you will learn much of anything in this course. I think the course content is only enough for maybe half a semester and I wish there had been a little more substance to the course. There is a group project which is always a drag because not every member is as committed to the team typically. We had one of three of our group members who did next to nothing on the group project and we picked up the slack. They are pretty lenient on grading the group project since they know this can be the case. Java is required for this course. I didn't have any prior experience with Java but I was able to pick it up well enough by dedicating a little more of my time at the beginning of the semester. If you already know Java it's a breeze.",

The class covers things like:\n- git\n- Basic Java\n- JUnit\n- Basic android development\n- Documentation \n- Testing \n\nmost of which you will probably know already, could easily pick up through some free courses on Udacity or YouTube, or is industry / company specific.

The TAs ran it extremely well and had the best office hours I've yet seen in the program. Unlike other classes I've taken, Professor Orso actually makes appearances on Piazza and in the office hours, and it's nice to see some actual involvement in the class. This is a very useful class if someone is in the program to make a career change and doesn't have a software background, but someone with existing experience in the field won't learn much. It is, however, a nice class to get accustomed to the format of OMSCS, as the first several weeks have a very small workload.\n\nThe group project is hell. It was a ton of work compared to the rest of the class and is a very jarring transition. Making matters worse is the fact that I am in the Eastern time zone and was paired with teammates in California, which made meeting as a group tough. During the four weeks of the group project, I was probably working 15-20 hours a week on this class, with the rest of the semester being no more than 3 or 4 hours per week. I will note, however, that I got paired with a very gung-ho group who went very above-and beyond the requirements for the app. You can probably get an A with a lot less work than what we put in, but that's going to depend on what kind of group you get. Obviously, my situation is preferable to the opposite extreme, but it was a rough few weeks.\n\nBesides the group project, I enjoyed the class. You won't get any frustrations coming form a lack of structure or organization and it serves as a great intro to OMSCS in general. It's also nice as it's one of the few classes other than GA that counts toward multiple specializations, so if you're on the fence between Interactive Intelligence and Computing Systems like I was, it would make a really good intro to the program.",

Good as a first class or to pair with another. \n\n**My Background**<br>\nSoftware Engineering with less than 1 year of experience. No undergraduate or graduate degree in Computer Science. Use Java & Github at work daily. \n\n**Estimated Workload:**<br>\n~5 hours per weeks, maybe slightly more during the group project. \n\n**Summary of assignments**\n1. Github Basics - Follow a set of instructions. \n2. Implement a simple Java function and write test cases. \n3. Code up a simple 1 screen Android app with a few buttons and basic logic. \n4. UML diagram for an app (this ends up being the app in the group project) (no coding)\n5. Group project (over 4 weeks, 1 deliverable per week) - Vocabulary Quiz App\n\ta. UML diagram (no coding)\n\tb. Documentation - Design, Functionality etc (no coding)\n\tc. Test cases & basic app (coding)\n\td. Final app (coding)\n6. Write test cases for a black box app (no coding)\n7. White box testing - Given a few scenarios, identify which white box framework they fall into. \n8. Individual project - Code up the black box in part 6. (over 3 weeks, 1 deliverable per week)\n\n**Takeaways**\n1. Read the instructions in assignments very carefully. You can easily miss points for silly things like mislabeling etc.  \n2. Assignments are released every Saturday morning and due the following Friday. Many students complained about this but I actually liked it. Use part of Saturday/Sunday/Monday to work on the assignment (each homework shouldn't take more than 5 hours). Use Tue/Wed/Thu to monitor Piazza, watch office hours, and make any minor changes. Submit the assignment on Friday. \n3. Both projects are pretty easy. Even if you get a bad group for the project, you can probably code up all of it yourself in under 20 hours (over the 4 weeks, so 5 hours per week)\n4. Office hours once a week - professor shows up along two head TAs. \n5. Assignment grading is slow, usually more than a month to get grades back. \n\n**Android Resources**\n0.  Learn how to set up buttons, user input, and sql lite databases. Skim through these resources. The 3rd assignment will also give you some experience with basic Android. \n1. Udemy ($10-$12) - I went through the first 1/3-1/2 of this course. (https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-android-oreo-developer-course/)\n2. Udacity Android Basics: User Input (https://www.udacity.com/course/android-basics-user-input--ud836)\n3. Udacity Android Basics: Data Storage (watch the section on SQL light) (https://www.udacity.com/course/android-basics-data-storage--ud845)",

Given that we had something due every Friday, it seemed like some assignments were put together to just give the students something to do.\n* Having deadlines on Friday (early Saturday morning in the US) caused some scheduling conflicts. The professor defends this practice by saying that this encourages students to start the assignments early and discourages procrastination.\n* The grading is very slow and tends to lag behind anywhere from one month to two months.\n* Group project team mates are randomly chosen based on a survey which can lead to widely different experiences.\n\nOverall this is an easy class for someone who has professional working experience. Other reviewers have mentioned that the group project is quite bad, however in my experience I was lucky to have good team mates that pulled their weight."

I STRONGLY suggest taking this class with another course (saving it to pair with a medium/harder class). All the topics were very relevant and applicable to work (as a software engineer). Android project was my favorite although it is nice to have some teammates on your team that know a thing or two about android app development, and can meet locally. NO EXAMS, only assignments and projects. Super relaxing in terms of the grading since no need to stress over exams. As long as you do the assignments properly and on time, you'll be ok.\n\nCons:\nHomeworks are released every Friday night and due the following Friday night. It can get annoying since its hard to work ahead if you have something in particular that you want to do for that week/weekend or manage your time in a more flexible way. Some assignments take less time and others take more time... so your week is kind of \"up for grabs\" depending on the assignment, makes it hard to schedule other things in your life (depending on what your priority is of course). TA's are a bit hard to get a hold of, and grading takes a while.",

Therefore, in my opinion, there is too strong of an emphasis given to it; while some other topics of SW process are not even mentioned (code review is one that comes to mind). Especially since there is another course that is focused on SW test only. Didn't like the TAs. The vast majority of the Piazza replies from them were single sentenced referring students to other posts, even though they could clearly add more value to the topic if they bothered spending more than 5 seconds on the response. This is usually a reflection on the importance the professor gives to the course and the students. \n\nIt would take an average of about 8 weeks for grades to come out. Which makes even less sense when the quality of the feedback given is taken into account. The TAs could easily be replaced with auto-graders as they clearly followed a very strict (and obscure) rubric with no variations/exceptions and provided no feedback on the assignment other than \"great job\" if you got 100% or three-word sentences referring to a rubric that the students don't have access to when you got something wrong on an assignment. Flat out ridiculous. This created a fabricated level of difficulty to the class, which I think they realized later in the course and gave the opportunity for a 20% extra credit on the individual project for something that was supper easy to obtain.\n\nEven if you are going through this program only for the degree and care very little about what you learn; save your money by selecting something else. There are other courses that offer an easy A but are not as wasteful of your time and money as this one.",

There is no possibility to learn from mistakes and correct before making the same mistakes again.  Also the UML portion felt like a complete waste.  I took the course as a requirement, if you have any experience you will likely learn little to nothing.",

For one assignment, I was one day late due to a late start and a seemingly easy issue that I can't get correct answer in piazza discussions. I struggled with this little problem until finally the professor pointed to the issue. I fixed it and submitted the assignment, but got half credit. I did feel that one of the course video is misleading that caused this mistake. \nLike some others have pointed out, you will be surprisingly got a low score for some unimportant minor things. I got a low score for another assignment, and even wanted to withdraw the course. Luckily, I stick to to it, and scored a lot better in later assignments and projects. I admitted that I learned a lot from this course, git, java, android, some database UML, whitlebox/blackbox testing, and most important of all, never give up.\nEventually, I got A despite some mistakes or unfortunate situations. It's good experience that I suffered in the beginning, while enjoyed at the end.",

Basically, if you're doing something wrong, by the time you get your grades, its too late to fix it. Also, grading is really petty. If you do 99% of the assignment right but a few small details, they mark off like 50%. A large portion of the group project grade is based on whether your group members said you contributed. Me and another group member did 95% of the group project work through out the project but because other group members scrambled the night that it was due and we didn't, they said that we didn't contribute. Overall it was a decent class but I wouldn't recommend as your first class because it might turn some people off to the program if they thought all classes were this disorganized.",

You have one week exactly per assignment, and no more, which for me made this class tough to pair with another. As soon as I finished an assignment for SDP, I'd try to work on class 2, but wait! There's already another assignment due for SDP. That said, it's a solid first course to get into the groove of the program, I did learn some stuff about, well, the software development process.\n\n**Class Structure**: \n- Weekly assignments, due on Friday nights. (Saturday 5am in California Time)\n- 1 group project that spans 3-4 weeks, a part due each week. 3-4 people/group. Involves building a simple app with Android Studio. Having never done this before (but having made a few *very simple* iPhone apps), I found it to be not that bad. I dislike Android Studio, but I managed. Toughest thing in the whole class is implementing a database on Android Studio for the group project, but thankfully someone else in our group did this. Documentation is important for group project. \n- All other assignments are weekly and done individually. Instructions are very clear and must be followed to the letter, in a sometimes annoying but ultimately helpful way. All assignments are very doable for novice coders. If you can make an if-else statement, you can pass this class. Having never coded in Java before, I survived, though with a healthy dislike of how Java deals with Strings!\n\n**Final Thoughts**: \n- Good first class. Take this class first, and don't pair it with another class. The weekly assignments makes the pace of two classes too stressful. Also I didn't like that the assignments were released Saturday morning because I don't have access to a printer at home. I would drive to work on Saturdays to print. Not fun. \n-Sometimes I felt like I wasn't learning anything, but only later did all the assignments come together. Overall glad I took this class to bring me up to speed on a lot of CS terminology I wasn't previously aware of (White/Black box testing, UML diagrams, etc). As I transition from mechanical engineering to CS work, I'm finding the terms I learn in class constantly pop up. Ergo, this class is doing something right. \n-Watch the videos a week earlier than listed on the syllabus so you immediately know what that week's assignment is about.\n-Teacher + TA's were great, always on Piazza. \n- If not for the weekly assignments, I'd pair this class with another one. I tried to, but ultimate dropped it because of the frantic nature of weekly assignments. Maybe double up the assignments and give everyone two weeks to do it?",

I came into it with an academic background in mathematics, but my day job requires use of java.  If you aren't familiar with java, do yourself a favor and study up on it before the course.  This course gives you a great opportunity to learn some java, learn how to use piazza, canvas, github, work with a team remotely, and just get the essence of OMSCS.  \n\nThe first couple of assignments were straight forward and easy to complete.  Once we started working with Android Studio, I had to do a lot of research to see how it worked, but was able to complete assignments working less than 10 hours a week.  This time requirement went up with the individual project.  I had a good group and our app was fully functional, but we put a lot of time and effort into it, up to 15 hours a week.  I spent some extra time on the final project in an attempt to earn some extra credit.\n\nTasks are assigned and collected on a weekly basis.  There is one assignment/deliverable each week.  They are due on Friday 12AOE, which is Saturday 7am EST.  There were no extensions and they will not release assignments early.  Be ready to work each week.  Professor & TA's are very active on piazza and hold a weekly office hour on YouTube Live.  Assignments were sometimes easy and sometimes challenging, but I was always able to confidently submit my assignments (except the uml diagram, but I got a 100).  \n\nDon't expect grades to be returned in a timely manner.  It took upwards of 3 weeks to a month to get grades back, though the grading always seemed fair, and they honor grade challenges.",

I am not a CS person (I am an Engineer) and still didn't learn didly squat on this course. Professor doesn't give a crap; TAs give single-sentence answers to Piazza questions (don't give a crap either); and, worse of all, there is a lot of busy work fabricated difficulty on the class that has absolutely nothing to do with the material announced at the course curriculum.

Its not a difficult class so you have time to acquaint yourself with all the different technologies used in OMSCS as well.  There is a group component to this class.  We filled out a survey and the instructor or TA's paired us up.  There are 3 group projects and 6/7 individual assignments.  There were no exams.  The class uses Java for all of the projects.  1 project was a very basic Android app.  You should at least have a basic understanding of Java so you can help your team in the projects.  The professor held weekly office hours and was actually pretty active on Piazza when I took this class.  In my opinion, I think this professor ranks as one of the top professors in the program.  He deserves a bit more recognition.  He has an ability to break thing down and make them seem so simple.  If you've been in development for very long, you realize how valuable that is.\n\nFor the experienced developers:\n\nIf you're already a software dev then you may find this course lacking new information to you.  If you still want to take this class even with experience, know that not everyone is on the same level as you.  This could be a chance to learn patients and leadership.  It may also be a good opportunity to gain some practice in mentoring people new to the field or subject.  Also, if worse comes to worse, and you end up on a team that doesn't contribute at all, all of the projects can be done by one experienced developer quite easily."

You learn about unit testing, Java, IDE, and UI basics, git and github, and UML design.\n\nIf you have an undergrad in computer science this course is easy but still managed to teach me a few things, like how to create an android app.\n\nHomework is frequent, one every week, but because they are so frequent the work is easy.  If you know unit testing, android programming, UML, or whatever, you will get the homework done in a few hours. No massive time sink projects like most every other class.  \n\nThe TAs are responsive, Piazza is helpful, the projects are easy yet interesting - A must-take class for everyone.  \n\nCons:\n\nI am surprised anyone could dislike this class.  All the complaints I am seeing on omscentral are minor.\n\nGrading is slow but that's *Every* class.  \n\nSome of the assignments are open-ended but that's exactly how it will be in the real world.  The github assignment was very nit-picky (I lost points for not capitalizing 'Assignment'), but I appreciate a challenge.  People seemed upset that certain scenarios were not covered and the TA always answered the same way, basically, 'its up to you', which I thought was great.  You get to actually learn, not just codemonkey paper to code.\n\nA significant number of people whined how assignments were due friday, not the usual sunday/monday, but frankly I don't get that.  It forces you to start work immediately, and that's a good thing.  What does it matter what day you run into problems on?  The TAs are less likely to answer questions on a saturday/sunday so I was very happy they were always available on a thursday night.\n\nSome were upset by the class being too easy - to those people I say: Go take Computer Vision, or Compilers, then come back and complain about things being easy.",

The assignments are completed in Java, the projects are based on creating Android Apps, and you use Git. I had never used Java, built an Android App, or used Git so it took me considerably more time than most because I had to learn those concepts as a went, but I would still say it's low difficulty.

My impression from Piazza was that the TA dislikes working with people. This is common with engineers, but is not a good trait for a TA.The assignment documentation lacks detail, and the TA's attitude was, \"take your best guess.\" This is not helpful in a class that is supposed to be teaching good development habits. A developer should never \"take a guess\" on a specification.\n\nThe lack of details in the assignments and individual project make work that should have been fun (but easy) significantly more difficult than it had to be for no return in learning.\n\nOn the other hand, the group project was very well designed. It was great idea to allow us to grade our teamates. This forced everyone to contribute and get along. I really enjoyed the team project.",

I put down an average of 12 hours/week for the course, but that includes 2 weeks of 40+ hours of class project work making up for the lack of participation of 2 people on a 4-person team. My other teammate was incredible, thankfully, and we pulled it out. Overall I would avoid this course if possible as there's not much to learn here if you have an undergrad in IT or engineering. Annoyingly, the instructor is very old-school when it comes to assignment release dates and downright fascist about requiring assignments to be turned in Saturday morning instead of Sunday evening/Monday morning like any rational person would.",

I have worked as a software developer for a few years but had not been involved in building complete applications so I thought I could learn a few things.  I certainly learned a few things here and there but a lot of it seemed  like common sense to me due to my work experience. Overall the class was very easy. It would take about 5 hours a week at most to take care of everything due for that week. The only exception to this was the group project. Despite the compressed schedule during the summer there were times I felt like I wasn't taking any class at all. The class covers the software development lifecycle and testing methodologies but never really goes in depth into any of the topics. As a result you will walk away with a basic familiarity of the material but nothing more. If you have absolutely no development experience this can be useful but I don't see much value in this course for anyone who has even a little bit of experience. The grading was very slow and as I write this having turned in my last project there is still about 50% of the work left to grade. The instructor is very enthusiastic and explains the material well. I enjoyed the lectures and the projects. I just wish we could have covered the material in more depth. In conclusion I would recommend this class to anyone coming from a non CS background and has not worked in industry. For the others, there is not much to learn here and your time and effort would be better spent taking one of the other classes.",

The head TA on repeated occasions (I won't out them by name here) is condescending and frankly never helpful. Their responses to Piazza posts (and given the fact that they answer the majority of posts) actively discouraged me from ever engaging with Piazza because I was concerned about asking a question that felt \"stupid\" or simple.\n\nThe projects are probably the worst part about the course. Many of them are simple, quick assignments that can be completed in a few hours if you have some Java knowledge. However, the layout and structuring around the projects (and the individual project itself) is a nuisance. The major issue is the assignment time frame. I took the course in the summer term, so the full semesters may be different. Each assignment was released on a Saturday and then due the following Saturday (7 days). No exceptions or previews. This means that if you have something come up for work, another class, etc. then good luck. You still have the same time frame. Not all classes in OMSCS give info ahead of time about projects. But when you expect students to turnaround an assignment in a single 7 day time window, there should be some level of foresight given upfront so they can plan for things. I had multiple occasions where I had to rush and turn in a subpar assignment because on Monday morning my work commitments would pile up for the week and I was left to choose between slacking off at my job or skimping on a course assignment.\n\nThe second major issue with the projects is that they are structured in an order which can actually hurt you later. For example, there's a project around the 4th or 5th project that requires you to build a testing suite around a program that doesn't actually exist, and you aren't supposed to implement the program. However, in the individual project (which is 20% of the course grade), you are then expected to implement the program AND it must pass your test suite from weeks prior without making any changes to the test suite. This means that if you misunderstood a requirements, didn't plan for something, etc. in the earlier project, then you'd potentially harm yourself in the later assignment (as you may have incorrect test cases based on assumptions at that point that you aren't allowed to change). Why is this necessary? It just seems like poor planning for the course structure.\n\nThe final issue with the projects is that some of them simply feel watered down and unhelpful. The second part of the individual project involved the instructions saying that you had to change your program from part 1 because of \"updated customer requirements\". In the real world, this happens. But in a graduate level course, what justifies this as an assignment? It is hard to see how that part of the project is anything more than busy work.\n\nGrading is slow and obtuse. They have a ton of students and about 6-7 TAs. The rough math comes out to 40-50 students per TA, which is actually about average for many courses. I am a TA for a course that has an assignment of about 45 students per TA. In SDP, they don't release grades for weeks. 8 weeks into the course, they have only finished grades for the first 4 (out of about 10-12) assignments. There is only a week left in the official course. So, they are considerably slower at grading than other courses in OMSCS, and don't expect feedback about earlier parts of large assignments before you complete the later parts. They also don't give any details about the grading for projects, so don't expect to understand where your grade comes from until the release grades, either.\n\nFinally, the course material is fine. If you have any experience in software development, it is going to seem basic and boring. There's nothing new or novel covered in the course. In fact, I honestly would put the course on par with an undergraduate SE course. It's inoffensive, and there is a grade for completing the quizzes so they \"force\" you to go through the materials. There are no exams, however, so there's no pressure to actually pay attention and absorb the material (unless you don't have any SE background and the material is new to you). The projects only require a cursory knowledge of the week's lessons.",

To make matters worse, you are very dependent on the group that you are placed in for the group project, which is by far the largest assignment. If you wind up carrying the burden of the development work, it can really suck. Also, the group project doesn't carry nearly enough percentage of the grade to justify the time investment. I think the class could benefit from having a more general Java development project rather than something so Android-specific (with next to no Android background being given). The rest of the class is easy peasy. Pretty much a waste of time. From the get-go, the professor and TAs have an antagonistic relationship toward the class, not budging an inch on the Friday due dates. There is no purpose to the fact that they don't release assignments more than a week ahead of time.",

Overall, it is a very gentle and basic class to learn Java and software design & testing \n\nVideo & Office Hour: it is short and fun to watch. Prof.Alex is very engaged and TAs are involved with Office Hour and have been on the Piazza all the time. Thumb up to Head of TA and Erin, who are most responsible TAs I've encountered so far in my education.\n\nAssignment &  Project:\n7 Assignment\n1 Group Project and 1 Individual Project\nFirst 3 Assignments teach you to write simple Java program in IDE.\nGroup Project is to step-by-step design and to build an Android App. I think it is a good intro for software development process, including documentation, UML, test plan and even some database skill to prepare the overall structure of the app. But don't worry about you have to do it all by yourself. Highly suggest you get a better computer in order to run the android studio smoothly. It saves your testing time for quite a bit.\nI think the Individual project is a little bit easy and less practical in term software design. Though it covered the course content of black-box testing and refactoring, we didn't get to practice that on a complete software program.(It is a small command line utility)\n\nIf you think you don't have any CS background, you could take this course as the only one and first course. If you have any background in Java or familiar with another programming language, I would suggest you to take this class with another medium or easy class in your first semester or take it in the summer.\n\nEnjoy this class with good discussion and helps from classmates!",

Be brutally honest about your skillsets to be matched correctly. There were few teams who had lot of trouble leading to disparaging discussions in Piazza.\n\nIf you have Junits and/or Java development experience, the assignments itself should be a breeze. The only problem would be a black-box testing assignment with no clue about what bugs you are looking for. I would recommend living with whatever is possible as at the end of the day, it accounts only for a small part of your final grade.\n\nIn the group project, attempt to identify an integration lead, ideally with Android experience. It would make all team mates lives simpler with each building one or more components and the lead integrating them together.\n\nI was the lead and all my other team mates either had paired this with other courses or were either getting a baby or moving, so getting the right team and responsibilities is crucial. There are 3 deliverables as a group and getting the dynamics is important to get them delivered.\n\n### Exams/Tests\nThere are no exams and all grading is done via Assignments\n\n### Office hours\nThis is the only 1 course out of the 3 that i have taken where the professor actually does a live office hours.\n\n### Parting words\nIf you have Java experience, this is a simple no-brainer class which can be clubbed together with another course. If you have no Java experience or haven't worked in a group, i would tread a bit light and look for an alternative if possible. The learnings are not that really extraordinary nor the effort worth the merit."

I didn't know much in terms of Android development so going from the first individual Android assignment to the group project was a bit of a stretch. Someone else in my group was knowledgeable about Android which helped. You don't get to choose your group, but you can assign preferences for meetings times. Hint: choose to meet early in the week before project deadlines.\n\nIndividual project is implementing a command line utility. The focus is on testing and refactoring.  It's straightforward, and while the black-box testing assignment doesn't provide much in the way of learning, I did find the overall project helpful for thinking about test cases and inputs.\n\nGood course to kick off the OMSCS program and pair with a harder course."

The class eases students into development the first few weeks by giving several introductory individual assignments at the beginning including a review of github, Java and Java testing. These will be a breeze for anyone who works as a software engineer already, but gives a nice review and catch up time to those who aren't. Thus, if you aren't a software developer you have a few weeks to ramp up. The group project was perhaps the most time consuming part of the class and also my lowest grade in the class. Overall, the group assignment was not so difficult technically, but the struggle of my group was procrastination by 2 members such that I didn't have time to review and fix what they worked on. The white box/black box testing assignments near the end of the term were interesting, though highly academic and theoretical. Overall, this is a great first class for the OMSCS program, especially if you are already a software developer. The class will also keep you on track with set deadlines and assignments coming out at manageable intervals.",

There are individual assignments with enough time to complete and a group project that is a small Android app. The lectures are fabulous in their flow and design and quite interesting, even if a lot of it might be familiar to someone working in software development. It was still helpful to have the material laid out in such a fun way. Getting an introduction to Android was also great.\n\nConsidering the ambiguous nature of the rest of the classes I've taken, SDP is now engraved in my mind as a sweet memory. I wish more classes were like this - I feel that many other classes try to cram an inappropriate amount of material, which causes them to be kind of all over the place.",

The weekly assignments differed greatly in difficultly and completeness of instructions, the TAs would help clarify - but if they thought it was clear enough they would stop.  \n\nI really disliked the Friday due date of assignments - the only way to make this work with the curriculum is to stay one week ahead of the published schedule otherwise the weekend is wasted as you don't have the background needed to make progress.  This made the course interfere with work much more than it should have, particularly for the bigger assignments.\n\nGrading was always really late - especially annoying for assignments that built on one another (and it turned out the multi-phase assignments only got one grade at the end.)",

I didn't get enough hands on experience with Android development to be confident enough to enter that field. I got SOME useful experience with black and white box testing which I liked. Other than that I got some Java experience and that's about it. There's an opportunity to get a little bit of project management experience if you volunteer to be the leader for the group project but the curriculum doesn't go into software project management. I do wish the group project was shaped to focus on a particular software development strategy (e.g Agile, Waterfall, etc). I also wish there was a project on refactoring as the lesson material covered that but the projects didn't."

Related, although I have experience as a software engineer, my current job is entirely different. So I also spent a good chuck of time creating a workable setup on my machine (Cygwin, .bashrc aliases, git). Finally, although Java is clearly stated as a prerequisite, my closest experience is C++ from 15 years ago. So coming up to speed there was nontrivial.\n\nPROS:\nProfessor Orso is a ton of fun! The lectures are great and the office hours are helpful. I enjoyed the material and appreciated the weekly assignment cadence. This course has been refined over many iterations, and the instructors are very clear that the decision to make each assignment due on Saturday morning is a deliberate one. Initially I was unhappy about this, but came to rather enjoy it by using some weekend time to get ahead on the homework rather than scrambling to meet the deadline. We were exposed to several technologies and tools (git, IntelliJ IDEA, Android Studio, Java, JUnit, markdown, XML). The Android Studio group project was a lot of fun. Groups were assigned based on mutually available meeting times and complementary Java experience, which worked out great! \n\nCONS:\nAssignment grades were consistently very late. I literally had no idea how I was doing in the course for the first half of the semester. (As a new student, this was particularly unsettling!) The instructors take grading very seriously, and go to lengths to ensure fairness by making sure grade distribution from TA to TA isn't skewed, releasing all grades simultaneously, and so on. I do prefer a fair grade over a fast grade, so I appreciated this. However, I think it's also reasonable to expect timely qualitative feedback, perhaps with a delayed quantitative grade. (Otherwise, there's no difference between OMSCS and watching Lynda videos!) I felt the lack of timely feedback hampered my learning and caused unnecessary anxiety.",

The Udacity lectures were informative with easy-to-grasp concepts, and Professor Orso has inspiring enthusiasm for the subject matter. This being my first course I can't compare to other GT classes, but this is easily the best online course I have ever taken. I appreciated the weekly YouTube office hours and was not required to post a mindless forum thread on a weekly basis, in contrast to my undergrad experience. The weekly workload is entirely doable if you read the instructions CAREFULLY and IGNORE your classmates' forum posts until you've absolutely hit a wall and need an answer to something in particular. Using this strategy, even while working 50 hour weeks I devoted about 4 days out of the week to schoolwork (this 1 class) and managed to get no less than a 94% on each assignment, I consider myself a software developer newbie with average intelligence. My favorite part of the course was the group project which we split up equally on documentation and coding, and I could not have asked for a better team. Having said all that, the TAs do take their sweet time on grading assignments, apparently especially if you choose to contest a grade (I did not), and I rarely saw any interaction by other TAs on the forum besides the two heads (perhaps they were grading?). There are some concepts that I would have liked to go deeper on, such as Agile, and the lectures could be updated with lessons on the currently used software. These did not manage to spoil my enjoyment of the course.",

I particularly liked the ones on Android and White-Box Testing. I plan on using what we learned about Extended TSL for automating test cases at work. \n\nThe bad:\n\n- Holy hell, the TAs are awful. I'm more than half-way done with my OMSCS degree, so this isn't my first rodeo - this has been without a doubt my worst course experience. The co-head TAs (Will and Erin) are defensive, easy to anger, slow to answer threads, and almost purposefully ambiguous in their replies to simple yes or no questions (e. g. \"is X a requirement?\" or \"Should the behavior be X or Y?\"). I'm a pretty agreeable person, but I feel like I need to get my blood pressure examined after each interaction with them on Piazza. \n\n- The assignment docs are poorly proof-read, contain errors, and are often ambiguous. \n\n- There is an assignment due every Friday night (or early Saturday depending on your time-zone). Assignments are released the previous Saturday morning. This wouldn't be so bad if the TAs were responsive - but posts routinely take 2-3 days to get a response. Usually the responses are ambiguous, defensive, and over-all unhelpful. All in all, this makes for a stressful weekly experience. SUGGESTION TO THE PROFESSOR: Please consider releasing assignments 1-2 days early (Thursday instead of Saturday). Or work with your TAs to get better response times. Or have the TAs do a better job at proof-reading the assignments beforehand. \n\n- Feedback is non-existent. It's November 10th, and we're still waiting for grades on assignments that were submitted back in September. The feedback we have gotten has been one or two poorly worded sentences. A silver lining is that the TAs grade easy; but I'm here to learn and feedback is crucial to that process. Other OMSCS classes do a really good job at feedback, so it's definitely possible with a class this size.",

I do not necessarily blame the professor, rather, the TA's. These are the worst TA's I have ever had. At this moment, we have been waiting for answers for questions for the assignment due this week (November 8, 2017), and it is 3 days and we haven't received answers. But guess what! Yes, when it comes to grade the assignments do not expect the best results, these TA's are like in the Olympus, untouchable. They use this autograde system that will never grade as a human does. Even if you are not very good developing, their comments or feedback will push down, making you feel like you are not worthy of becoming a developer, or something else, because we have to be honest, this master program isn't to make 'software developers', it is for anybody in the area of computer science: IT engineers, developers, architects, etc. The name of this course sounds interesting, but the content to me is awful. I don't know the reason we have to be doing like more than 50% in software testing if there is already a course called 'Software Analysis and Testing'. \n\nBy the way, get ready to be part of an experiment, when it comes to use this tool called 'TSLGenerator'. There is no valuable information on the internet for this, nor videos, etc. Nothing! The little you can learn you get from the Udacity lectures. So, the only reason I am taking it is because it is one of the options as requirements. The other course is 'Computability, Algorithms, and Complexity', thus, either you take SDP or you take CAC. \n\nThe schedule for assignments due? The worst! They are due every Friday night; Saturday morning for some people. I wonder why they do that, when other courses assignments are due on Sundays. It looks like the people leading this course do not have a sense of humanity. They do not care if you have a family or if you are in another course: assignments are due every week on Friday!"

There is no major challenge to the projects themselves, as they aren't designed to test you on your ability to solve problems, just how well you follow process and complete documentation (which isn't a complaint, that's the point of the class!). Unfortunately, there wasn't much engagement in the process beyond wrote tasks and standard documentation. Since the projects are fairly trivial, it seems silly to spend so much time on design and discussion, so hopefully in the future they use projects that are a bit more complex, or maybe having to deal with changing requirements or incomplete requirements. That being said, if you don't have any experience in software development or process, this is probably a good introduction to it. \n\nIf I were to give advice to those taking the class, I would say two things:\n 1. Be careful with your time, the Summer section was quite fast-paced, and it is easy to fall behind. The instructors insist on making things due on Friday, and make things *very* awkward for those who work. You can get some of the projects done on the weekend they open, but Piazza comments and project errata will appear during the week, so you still have to work around your weekday schedule unfortunately!\n 2. Check your work over until you feel paranoid about it. The instructors are *not* very compassionate nor understanding when it comes to simple mistakes. I personally was only affected by this once at the very beginning of the course, but two of my teammates lost a full letter grade due to this. If something isn't compatible with the auto-grader, or there was a simple typo in a commit hash, function name, etc., then expect to receive zero points for that portion of the assignment, with no real wiggle room!",

You write a lot of docs, code the project, then backfill your docs with what really happened. You create one really useful diagram that makes you think, and a ton of expository writing that just fills pages. So, a lot like any highly regulated domain. This presumably forms the core of the class. \n\nHowever, in summer, you get the thrill of concurrent group and individual assignments. The individual assignments contain a lot of \"aha!\" moments that can take hours or days to find. But you don't have hours or days - you spent those on Android. I bet these individual assignments carry meaning in a longer term. In summer, they stand in the way. The course lectures don't have the information or the presentation quality to pull off \"aha\" assignments. Most of what you need, you find googling. And you don't share what you find because you never know how close you walk the line of distributing unfair information. \n\nI would have felt much happier ignoring the lectures and spending that time on the individual assignments. Really, they do not help. \n\nLast point (completely serious): The instructors do not believe in the western tradition of starting things on Monday. They live in an alternate calendar. Get ready to fight it out with your bosses and spouses. This course has no respect for your school/work/life balance, and throws many obstacles in your way. Much harder courses strike the balance, why can't this?",

Grading is very fair although one of my complaints in a lot of these lower level classes is that roughly 50% of the class gets 100% on assignments and then there is a steep drop off. You either aced the testing criteria the TA / Professor had in place or you lose 10, 15, 30%. I would rather see an actual bell curve where very few students get 100% even if the majority get 90+. \n\nBesides the group project, all of the programming required is on par with sophomore level programming classes especially if you have any Java experience. For the other assignments such as defining test cases, diagrams, etc. I only found about 20-30% of it actually value added but I appreciate being exposed to these various tools even if at the end of the day I didn't find many of them useful in the real world. \n\nFor the group project, as many others have mentioned, it is very dependent on your teammates. That being said, you can do yourself a big favor by assigning tasks based on individual skills, don't try to break it up \"evenly\" or \"fairly\". If one member of your team writes android applications professionally there is nothing wrong with having that person write the entire app themselves. Another person do all of the diagrams, and another all of the writeup. Run your team like you would an interdisciplinary team at work. \n\nI gave 3 stars as I personally didn't learn much in this class, if you come in to OMSCS with a lot of coding experience its ok to skip this one and take something more challenging or interesting.",

A good course to be reminded of them. The TAs and Prof are very active on Piazza. \nI took it in the summer so there was one assignment every week, which can be a little frustrating. \nThe team projects needs collaboration. I had an awesome team. The tip, respect other people's opinion, its ok to give in sometimes and keep it simple... and do not take anything personal.. its all about the grade. \nThere is one individual project.. follow up on piazza to get through it.. I got it working due to posts on piazza.. \n\nGood luck.",

The group project can be either very easy or very hard depending on your group - in my case, it wound up being incredibly time consuming (>40 hours one week because I had two absentee group members). I wouldn't recommend taking this course in the summer for just that reason - I don't think they scale the project back for the accelerated schedule, and one bad week of coordination can tank your schedule. \n\nThe lectures are informative and well-done. The professor and TAs are very involved with the class, and I'd take another course from Orso in a heartbeat. \n\nIf it's been a while since you've worked as a software engineer in a modern environment, this is a great course. If you're like me, and have been one for more than half a decade, it's probably less valuable.",

The projects were sufficiently entertaining and educational. Some prior OO and GUI programming experience will go a long way to eliminating any frustrations with this class. \n\nThe group project experience depends largely on the project partners who are assigned to you. I worked with excellent individuals, and the 4 of us just automagically dove into our imagined roles and pounded out a project with a good score. Though there is a mechanism to adjust scoring should there be inequities in contribution from the other group partners (or so I've heard). \n\nBased on conversations with others, there were additional projects that are now in place where they weren't present previously in prior summer semesters. The final projects (both group & individual) were running somewhat in parallel and can make things busy."

Professor highly involved along with TAs. Highly recommended. Assignments released on Friday, due Friday (7 days). Makes a good, getting back into academics, course. \n\nPrep: Have good familiarity java and android development; have the ability and time commitments to work with a team to get a group project done. \n\nMy expectations of this class were to refresh some of the basics that I already knew from coding in industry for 7+ years. The class met these expectations, but relied on some outdated information and documentation that is not actually used in the real world industry. \n\nThe course was a great overview of what it takes to develop software from the systems or business side of things. Not just the guts of programming. The course takes you through the steps from initial concept, requirements gathering, documenting designs for approvals, prototyping, reviewing designs again, implementation, testing, and final presentation\\shipment for a software project. \n\nThe class leans more towards requirement gathering and documentation then programming, so be prepared for that. \n\nThe course had almost no flaws in it, besides the team picking process and getting the students to work together, but that is a separate issue. The TAs and professor were very helpful and willing to see the students learn the material. \n\nAs others have mentioned, while this is a decent course for those who are not good programmers, you still need to be able to program to take this course. This is a Computer Science Masters degree after all. This course also has little learning for industry experienced developers, but it worked as a decent transition back into academia after being out of it for a while.",

The assignments and individual project account for over 70% of the final grade, the group project accounts for another 25% (split 15% for the actual project and 10% for your teammates' assessment of your collaboration), with a a few remaining free points from Udadcity tracking whether you watched the lectures and did the quizzes. As long as you follow instructions, the grading isn't very strict. This class pairs well with other classes, though be aware that the workload during the month or so of the group project can be higher than for typical weeks. Professor Orso and the TAs were very involved and helpful. My main complaint was that the pace of grading was pretty slow.",

                        "body": "This was one of the two courses I took my first semester in OMSCS. I come from a non-CS background and do not code for a living (Im actually in recruiting - ie.. sales). I have never written Java, never been exposed to unit testing, heard of UML but never messed with it. I do have a lot of procedural based coding experience, as well as have developed a CRM using MySql back end in VBA. I have done some PhP/MySql too, but not much. \n\nI couldn't recommend a course more highly, especially for a new student in the program. Dr. Orso was a joy in class, was involved weekly, always available, active on Piazza, and the weekly office hours were fantastic. More importantly for me, the projects made me think. I always (once released) said - oh, this wont take long. Once I got into it - I realized that the assignments were a little more involved and thought provoking than I first thought. The only assignment that I really wish were reviewed was the Category-Partition testing assignment. We had lectures on the subject, we used the application; however, I totally see the value in the tool, but not sure I really understand the best way to choose and assign categories and parameters. \n\nAs for the group Android project, I hit the mother-load with group members! All 4 of us put in a ton of effort on the project, and our grade reflected the work we did. We started early on the assignments, followed the instructions, completed the writing / required documentation, and by meeting multiple times during the week all assignments were submitted and complied with requirements. \n\nIf I had one recommendation, to me, the group project (15% weigh) should have been weighted higher. I certainly worked much more on that than I did on the individual project (which had 20% weight), it consumed more weeks in the course, and was a much more comprehensive effort than the individual project. \n\nTA's were Great and active daily. This class totally flipped how I approach software development!",

If you have programmed in an OO language before, this class is a huge waste of your time. Several of the projects are tedious and are of limited value to programming In Real Life. \n\nExample: In one project the assignment asks you to write 30 black-box test cases for \"test-driven development\" - when you have the source code (that you wrote) right in front of you. Actual worthwhile tests that you might write in industry are frowned upon. The standard \"red-green-refactor\" is barely mentioned in one lecture, and never really asked for in any assignment. \n\nGrading is unbelievably slow. Assignment feedback (when you get it) is random and worthless. If you want an easy foundational class, go for it. If you want to learn something useful, avoid. This class made me seriously consider dropping out of the OMSCS program. \n\nI should say something positive. If you've never written an Android app, you'll get that opportunity. The group project is also somewhat enjoyable if you find yourself in a good group (which I did).",

I really appreciate his breadth of knowledge and enthusiasm for the material. I was very impressed (and relieved) by the quality of the online delivery system and Piazza classroom forum. \n\nWhat I liked most about CS 6300 is that it differed from your typical boring, textbook heavy software development course that beats SDLC to death. There is no textbook and no exams. Just quizzes and projects. I really enjoyed the projects because they were opportunities to apply course concepts. We learned Git, Android development, MD format, JUnit testing, and so much more! Many of the tools, such as IntelliJ and Android Studio (and even Git), I had never touched before. I learned so many useful tools and concepts that directly applied to my professional work. \n\nAlthough the majority of reviewers rate this course as easy, I caution others not to under-estimate the effort required. I finished with an A but it did require an all-nighter once or twice to meet deadlines and weekly deliverables. Having a programming background definitely helps, especially Java. If you have zero programming background or you're not strong in it then be prepared to suffer a little. The course will not be impossible but I found it challenging enough to meet deliverables because the week seemed to go by so fast between keeping up with lectures, quizzes, and the assignments themselves. I have over 10 years experience developing in C++, C#, Java, VB. NET, SQL, and some HTML and PHP and I felt I was barely prepared. There was still a lot of new learning I had to do and had to do it fast in order to complete assignments on time. I am thankful my group had others with programming experience. It is true that grading is slow but I feel the TAs were doing the best they could. I never felt the slow grading affected my progress or learning.",

Some were easy, some not so much. I had a great group for the project so overall I loved the course. I felt like it was challenging enough for me but not too much, to be discouraging. I learned stuff and more importantly felt confident about getting back to school and taking harder courses. \n\nThere was a lot of gripe from people in the class about how easy the course was and I can see how it might have been.

I had multiple instances where they used the wrong commit (mistakes happen), but again, they are quick to resolve these issues if you talk to them about it. \n\nCourse is entirely project based, with a group project, and a series of individual projects. Not being able to select your group is annoying, because the group project is pretty large and the time frame is really small. I ended up getting a team where two students did not pull their weight, and I had to do a large portion of the work, putting me in the position where I had to play catch up for that class and another class for the rest of the semester. Some of the projects can feel like busy work as well. \n\nKnowing Java is ideal, but knowing Android will really help you on the group project.",

The course is very well organized and provides a great coverage of the full-cycle of the software development from requirement collection to test-driven software development. There is no difficult concept to understand, the challenge of this course is really the follow the schedule and deliver assignment project on a weekly basis. I had no Java and Android development experience before, this course provided an excellent introduction to these two topics. The assignment for testing, i. e., white-box and black-box are really interesting. The instructors did a great job to design the individual assignment, which wraps up the important concepts and techniques of the entire course nicely. To me, the most challenging part of the course is the group project, this is partial due to the time commitment to work together with one free rider in the team. We struggled quite a bit, but in the end managed okay thanks to the generous grade given by the TAs. It would be easier for us to keep track of the course progress if the grades were released a bit earlier though.",

The concepts of software development tends to be overlooked. A good software is not just good coding. The workload is fine. There is deadline almost every week. It is a good course to refresh your java programming skill or even learn it if you don't have much experience. The grading is lenient. I would actually recommend any Non-CS background student to take this course even though it appears to be easy, but many of the concepts in the course are basic but important to know as a formal CS student and can tell whether you are a CS student or CE/EE student if you don't know them.",

                        "body": "I definitely recommend this course as an intro to the OMSCS program. The professor is energetic and involved. The assignments were mostly practical and allow for proficiency with a bunch of development tools. Programming is in java, and db experience helped a lot with the group project. Speaking of the group project - I had a wonderful group and really enjoyed the group assignments, however some had a more negative experience. We were not allowed to select our groups so you have to make the best of what you are given. \n\nThe four weaknesses of the course were 1) VERY slow turnaround with grading. 2) The rubrics were not published and some of the grading seemed a bit nit-picky. There was one case in particular where instructions for a deliverable weren't entirely clear, yet grading was strict on that section. 3) I was a bit disappointed with the final project since it wasn't something one would ever encounter in the real-world, and it did not add much to what we had already learned in the class during the semester. 4) The Friday midnight deadlines were rough, especially since office hours weren't until Weds evening. Would have preferred a Saturday midnight deadline so that some of the weekend could be used to finish things up after office hours. \n\nBottom line is that you will leave this course with a good understanding of the pros and cons of different development approaches. You will have completed some interesting white and black box testing assignments, and you will get a good start on Android development if you have never dabbled in that before. The professor and TAs are genuinely supportive. This is a relatively low-stress way to get back into an academic environment after being out of the classroom for many years.",

However, you learn some useful development methodologies that are useful when you work on long projects or when you work on group projects. Also, you learn about test driven development which is a useful thing to know. Android development in this class is not that difficult. For the first android assignment, you practically follow a tutorial by the instructor with minor changes. For the group project, you will also use android but it is not that difficult as well. You will need to know how to integrate databases in your app as well as how to navigate through views in android. Other assignments are not bad and can be completed comfortably within 2 days. The instructor and TAs are involved and quite active on Piazza and generally do a good job in answering questions and clarifications."

I work at a large company in a division that develops software, and learned much about what certain processes are, why we do things a particular way, alternatives that could be explored and areas that could be improved. The actual coding of the class project was beyond my technical capabilities without a lot of additional work, but fortunately some of my teammates were well versed in programming Java and Android, and I was able to pick up more/most of the work on the requirements and documentation side to make up for it, which obviously helped and felt like a fair distribution. You will need some basic Java programming on your own as well, but if you have any kind of a programming background and take any beginners-level course, like the one offered by Udacity, you'll be fine. The instructors is fantastic and funny, and the TA's are very helpful and responsive. We went nuts with Piazza, which made it hard to keep up with, but that was our fault. Overall I highly recommend this class, even though it's not a killer I think everyone who doesn't have a highly detailed background in large-scale software development and management can benefit from it.",

Professor Orso was a very strong teacher and his passion for the subject definitely bled through his lectures and office hours. I would advise that there is a TON of \"ticky-tacky\" grading in certain assignments especially where instructions are incredibly vague or opaque. I struggled not because the material was difficult but because assignments were never entirely clear or the lectures didn't adequately prepare for assignments so you're left researching stack overflow and other places for hours. The projects depending on Android development was a blast! It was cool to see Orso start us off on a mobile project and then implement some of the SDP concepts on the project. Also, you're gonna need a good team for the project. By good I'm not talking about dev-savvy (though it helps). Good in this context means good communicators and overall team members. I had a fantastic team where we could depending on each other and split work appropriately. At the end of the day though, I have a tad bit of a bitter taste in my mouth because of a few assignments and some grading that I didn't agree with 100% (and I'm not the complaining type for this stuff). If Orso and his crew were to re-work some assignments this would be a 5/5 course for me. As it stands it's somewhere between a 3-4/5",

This course teaches a lot of the fundamental software development processes and techniques that you need to know in the real world but that aren't necessarily taught in undergrad or other grad classes. I would definitely recommend it as the first course you take in OMSCS and also strongly recommend it if you haven't worked as a professional software developer but are looking to break into the field in the future. \n\nI have been a professional software developer for 10 years so I wasn't sure how much I would get out of the class however I did learn some new tricks and techniques in it so I think it is worth it even for people who have done software development in the \"real world. \" \n\nThe class strikes a good balance between learning new subjects in the lectures and testing that knowledge by doing fairly simple programming assignments. The class is paced well and I didn't feel overburdened except for a couple weeks where we had invidividual and group assignments in the same week. \n\nThe group project, like all group projects, is hit and miss depending on the group members you are assigned. If you have someone not pulling their weight it can be a nuisance. That said the grading in general is fairly generous as long as you put forth effort.",

I\u2019m working as Software Engineer but I still feel the class is fun and worth taking. It brushed up my git skills and introduced me to Android programming. \n\nThe instructor (Prof. Orso) is very active and always conducts office hours every week, he is also always present in piazza (except nearing the end of the semester, when he and all TAs were overwhelmed with grading and grade challenges). \n\nThe load is quite constant and I spent about 5-7 hours a week, except for the Android team project, which I spent almost 50 hours across 3 weeks span. But that\u2019s more because I wanted to deliver a \u2018nice looking UI\u2019 with a close-to-non-existent Android expertise. \n\nThe contents are pretty straightforward and easy to grasp. There is no exam but instead your grade comes mostly from assignments and projects. Having said that if you want to get an A, you have to focus on the details of each assignment and project, making sure to deliver what the instructors expect from those assignments and projects (make sure to attend/play later the \u2018optional\u2019 office hours too, as often clarifications are given here - even though usually the piazza also has a corresponding thread). For some deliverables, the instructors may deduct quite some points for non-compliant items, so don\u2019t underestimate the seems to be easy assignments and projects. The grades are also not curved (90+ to get an A) so it is important to get a good grade for every assignment/project. \n\nOverall, it is a great course, and I recommend taking it especially for new students as an introductory course to OMSCS and Software Engineering.",

My biggest complaint is that the grading was all over the place. Some assignments were graded harshly while others seemed to only be glanced at. At least for the Spring 2016 semester it seemed that they didn't have enough TA/graders to handle the number of students. \n\nGroup projects: Project 1 was kind of silly, Project 2 was a good first \"real\" Android app. Groups are teams of four, and your workload will probably depend on your team members. The second project was the most time consuming part of the course. \n\nNo exams. \n\nOverall: If it weren't for the nice introduction to Android I would regret taking this course. It is really meant for students who are new to CS (or at least Java) or have been away from it for a while. \nI took this class with Introduction to Operating Systems. It was a doable double (A in both courses) but I didn't get to do as much \"reading on the side\" as I would have liked. \nThis is the only class I have ever taken (including undergrad) where all Piazza questions were answered.",

However, I still recommend some preparation beforehand such as learning basics of git commands and java program through the free Udacity courses if you are very new to the program. \n\nThe quality of the class is very good as lectures are well structured and clear. I hear different opinions around project assignments but the class will try to assign a project team with good mix of experience (i. e. balanced) with common available time slots as much as possible. My experience on project was very positive and I felt like I was really in school having a weekly hangout meeting with colleagues. \n\nOpportunity for improvement I felt was the lead time for assignment grades and opportunities to practice white box and black box testings. The class gives some good examples but it would have been nice to go deeper in these area. \n\nOverall, very good class to take and I enjoyed almost all assignments and exercise in this class."

However, this will probably be my lowest grade at GA Tech, because their grading rubric and assignment weights are absolutely asinine. They would deduct huge amounts of points for trivial, ridiculous, or even subjective reasons. \n\nThey would also derive requirements from posts between students, or from optional office hours (note: there was a special requirements interview office hours, and I'm not referring to that one) and then grade against those arbitrary requirements, which I found to be rather uncalled for and unbelievable. \n\nThere's a lot of group work, and every week some project or assignment will be due, so the workload is very consistent, you will be putting in hours towards this class every single week for the full semester. Take this into account if you have a lot of business trips or plan to take any additional courses while taking this one. \n\nFor the good:\nThe lecture videos are some of the best I've seen at GA Tech and the android application development was really fun, plus there were consistent office hours on google hangouts every week.",

Most of the assignments were fun, interesting, and not overwhelmingly challenging. I wasn't crazy about the group projects because there's always a roll of the dice with the quality of your teammates, but it mostly worked out ok. \n\nThere is one major problem with the class, though: they were extremely ineffective and providing timely feedback for assignments. We had weekly assignments and in many cases it was over a month between submission and when the grades were released. This made the assignments quite a bit less effective than they could have been. Every week the head TA made commitments about when we'd get our next wave of grades back and he virtually never followed through on those commitments. Were it not for this significant shortcoming, I'd say the class was outstanding."

Alex also has office hours every week where you can ask more questions if you have them. The course material is well laid out, the assignments are easy to understand what is required, and the lectures are well done. \n\nNow for the not so good:\n\n* This course is easy. I have only a sliver of a Java background, and this was enough to get through the paper just fine. \n* This course covers things like using an IDE and git. If you're a working programmer like myself, you will probably already know this. \n* The grading on the group assignments is focused on the paperwork you produce, not the code. We turned in an assignment that failed half the instructor tests and still got an 80 or 85. \n* There is a significant amount of group work in this paper. I was in a different time zone to my colleagues and ended up doing 6am meetings most of the time. \n* I didn't really enjoy the material. The course is about the software development process, not coding, and it covers a lot of tools that aren't relevant to me as a working programmer, e. g. UML, Rational Unified Process, e. t. c. However this is the point of the course so I shouldn't be too surprised :)\n\nOverall, this is a good paper to take if you're new to OMSCS and want an easier paper to start with, to learn the ropes of taking papers. If you've already met your foundational requirement, and aren't interested in more enterprisey processes, and are looking for challenging papers, then I wouldn't recommend this one. However I must emphasise again, how well Alex and the TA's run this course.",

The projects do take some time but as long as you are willing to put the time in, you will have no problems. \n\nTake this course!",

I enjoyed the content very much, which was an advanced rehearsal of the software architecture classes I received in college, and the programming portion wasn't difficult at all. \n\nThere was a lot of documentation to write. You need to be ready for it and feel comfortable creating UML diagrams and writing lots and lots of content. This is tricky because your evaluation will highly depend on what somebody else interprets of your writing. In Software there are usually multiple ways to skin a cat, so you need to make sure to show the instructors that your way is a valid one. \n\nThe course uses Java throughout. If you have used it before, you shouldn't have any problems getting by. The material is not complicated, and I enjoyed the different programming assignments. The final project is the development of an Android application, which will take some time. I did Android before, so I felt right at home, but I saw some people struggling because the learning curve wasn't easy. \n\nDuring the class, you are part of a team that works the projects together. Teams are somehow hit or miss; there's usually somebody that does very little to help during the class. If you are unlucky, you can find yourself bearing most (if not all) of the work. At the end of the project, you get to evaluate each team member, which is appropriate and forces people to try to be helpful. \n\nIn the end, it was an excellent course, and I loved the material. Although I was very familiar with the topic, I had the opportunity to rediscover things that I had long forgotten. The workload stretched me enough, and I highly recommend it for anyone working in the Software industry.",

Other topics are very advanced, like 'write a non-trivial database-aware Android app in 2 weeks, including test cases and other stuff'. It seems to me like anyone who was new to the former is going to get completely sunk by the latter, and anyone who is capable of the latter is going to be bored out of their skull by the former and then be surprised by 'oh... we actually have to work in this class!' halfway through. For this reason, I think the class should be split in two, so that people can take only the portion that is relevant to them. I'll echo other commenters' statements about group work - do not like it, and in the future will only look for classes that involve solely individual work.",

I already had some years of experience in software development and I still gained a good amount of knowledge. This class will give you the foundation so you can go deeper into software development processes so don't expect to be able to run a team of develpers, planners, testers, etc. just by taking this class. I say this because some people complained about the content of the class. If you don't have prior experience with software development and Java programming, you may need to spend a lot more time. Also, there was an Android project which I think it wasn't too bad but some people complianed about the need to learn a lot of things in a short period of time. The workload will increase towards the middle of the class since you may have individual assingments due while you are still working on a group project. Overall, I think this was a very enjoyable course.",

Lectures were average, but I admire Prof Orzo's enthusiasm. Group projects were terrible - if possible I will never take a group project class in this program again. Students should have to pass some coding pre-reqs to take this course because unprepared students are a huge burden on teammates; 'just' working on documents is no panacea because if they aren't involved with or don't understand the difficulty of implementing requirements, it hurts the entire team. There is zero involvement from TAs in managing group conflict, and no real authority structure to groups. We had a team member who refused to do any coding but argued for adding *more* features than the assignment required. I don't need that kind of drama.",

I had a great experience with my group however I am aware that this was not the case universally. GATech make an effort to place at least one experienced Java dev in each group so even if you are not particularly strong in programming, you can fill another role in the group such as testing and/or documentation. There are individual programming assignments as well however these are considerably easier than the group projects. The overall progression of the assignments simulated a typical system development lifecycle project (with a RAD twist) with all the associated deliverables; systems requirements doc, prototype, test case doc, UML model, user manual, etc. I found that it was possible to deliver the assignments without really watching the lectures however part of your grade is based on your completion of the udacity quizzes so I guess this encourages you to watch all the lectures. This is a great course to ease yourself into the OMSCS program.",

Lecture content was presented clearly, however some things required extra research on my part (ie. Android development, JUnit testing, GitHub usage, etc. ), but hey THAT'S WHAT GOOGLE IS FOR. Prof. Alex and the course instructors are very good about responding to PIazza posts. You DO need an understanding of Object Oriented concepts, even if it's not Java. I've had some Java and C# training (but minimal experience) so I was able to pick up the material fairly easily. I'm glad to have learned some of the administrative and testing components to software development (inc. the project plan, use case diagrams, testing methods, etc. ). \nGROUP PROJECTS --> As mentioned, I was fortunate to be in an awesome group. However lots of people were not so fortunate. There IS a teammate rating form given at the end of each project because of this.",

I will try and avoid classes with group projects from now on. In terms of grading, even when I thought my submission sucked, I got a decent grade. Even not knowing enough java, I would have gotten a B on my own but my awesome group assignments pushed me to an A. I hope in the future they reconsider that Android app project as it is just way too much in that short time (maybe extra crappy due to summer?)",

The material explored many topics but none of them in-depth, in some cases were just basic tutorials for tools like git and Eclipse. The assignments felt more like jumping through hoops rather than being challenged to think critically and be creative. Overall the course felt disorganized and vague, most of the time I was not confident that I actually understood what was required and had to read a lot of forum posts for clarification, even on extremely simple busy work assignments. The most effort in the course is required during the group projects, which can include students anywhere on a spectrum from not being able to write code at all to having 10+ years of Java experience. A lot of groups had problems and partially due to that the last group project was changed to a solo project at the last minute. I think I would only recommend this course to beginners who are confident that they can write Java code but do not have much software development experience beyond that. If you know absolutely nothing about concepts like source control, test coverage, and UML then you will learn a lot. If you already have a lot of experience in software development and want to explore software engineering concepts higher than a very basic level, this course is not for you.",

Professionally not many places use formal UML modeling anymore and I think there was too much emphasis put on formal documentation to be truely representative of the real world. The individual assignments were okay (not too difficult) but they were looking for a very specific way for them to be implemented which in my opinion were just bad design. The course instructor was one of the most engaging though which made it an alright experience. As others have commented the group work is awful, there is such a huge gap in experience and certain team members carry the lions share of the burden. I understand it's trying to represent 'real-world' work where you have to collaborate with a team, but in the real world you don't have people with so little programming experience who are still gainfully employed, and quite frankly the 'project-manager' role for the project doesn't have an equitable share of the work.",

I suspect if you are good in Java this will help out tremendously. One of the most important variables is that you get placed into a good group since several of the projects are group based. For example our group worked very well, but many others complained in the forums about issues they were having where some team members were dead weight. Because of this your experience can vary greatly. You definetly need to know some Java going into this class. My knowledge was limmited to one class I took several years back, but was able to catch up quick by taking other online tutorials and READING BOOKs as I went and I Googled ALOT! The last project (originally scheduled to be a group project but changed after complaints about groups) was a solo project and very large. My project ended up being over 500 lines of code. It was a good challenging project and I am a better Java programmer for it. Also learning Android development for the first time was fun!",

I came in to this class with 6 or 7 years of. NET development experience, but no Java/Android experience. I had to spend a little extra time on the assignments to transition my. NET knowledge over to Java, but it was easy to do so and the assignments are relatively basic. I would think that someone with zero programming experience would want to take a quick intro before jumping in, though. There were two group projects in this iteration of the class, which I'm normally not a fan of but they complemented this class nicely. Good simulation of working as part of a team in the real world. I felt like the way they handled grading the team vs. individual contributions was fair. I had a great group that had no problems working together, so I'm not sure how any serious conflicts within the team would be handled if the professor/TAs had to be involved.",

I've been doing professional development for over 20 years and honestly didn't really expect to learn much.... however I did (and a few things I had forgotten from the past got reinforced). I thought the professor's lectures were extremely professional and actually entertaining. Online resources including Piazza, Google Hangouts, and regular office hours from the professor and TAs also helped. I've taken four other graduate courses online at another school and this blew those away in terms of quality of content, interaction with other students and staff, and sophistication of projects requested of us. As an aside, I want to note here that anyone taking this course should invest in learning Java fairly well before diving in. It's a poor excuse to be taking an MS CS course but claim you're unable to do the project work because you're not a programmer. This is CS - it requires coding skills and this course definitely utilizes those skills. Just be glad it's Java and not Lisp or Erlang....",

The content was decent but I would have preferred much more focus on Agile. Knowledge of Java would help but anyone with reasonable coding experience in any language should pick it up quick. My one serious concern is that, though the team projects did take some significant time and effort, the individual assignments were relatively simple (but also fun and good learning tools). However, it seemed many students made them much harder for themselves than necessary but you couldn't help others too much in that respect without violating the honor code. I think KISS and YAGNI should be part of the lesson plan."

I am generally not a fan of group assignments, but I was lucky enough to be assigned to an awesome group. Even still, there was overhead in scheduling meetings and whatknot. Overall, I would definitely recommend taking this course and think it is a doable amount of work for a summer semester. P. S. A couple of students had issues with the way that 'extra credit' items we rolled into the final grade (somewhat ironic since the final assignment was a 'Student Grader'). As such, I would recommend doing 'extra credit' tasks whenever possible as many of them were pretty straightforward.",

There was only one issue with an assignment due to semantics but was graded fairly by the professor. This class is more focused on the documentation more than the actual programming itself. The latter part I found quite trivial and this was without any java experience. Pretty much if you watch the videos you should get enough knowledge on how to do the assignments and it should be a pretty easy A.",

I believe if you have trouble with the programming in this class, that may be a sign to find a new major. I haven't done much Java (mostly C#) and I had no issues translating between them. The other complaint is about group work. I imagine this depends on your group. I had a great group. 3 programmers and a professional PM. We spent a lot of time together, which was the hardest part, but we worked well together and I learned a lot about group work. Some weeks I spent very little time in this class. The start is slow and was a little boring, but when the group projects started I spent quite a bit more time talking to my group. We likely didn't have to, but we did. The lectures are entertaining and insigtful. They do a good job of creating interest and are a good starting point for further learning.",

The one hickup to this class is that your experience will depend heavily on what group you were placed into, as the second group project was somewhat complicated if you don't have prior Android and SQL experience.

I was lucky and was assigned an amazing team of individuals that pulled together to get everything done. I know of others that were complaining about their teamamates. In any case, I believe that just reflects real life anyway. I highly recommend this class. Ended up getting an A in the class."

The groups are 3-4 people each, and it can take more time than you expected due to the various concerns of your group members. You'll find that they approach things a bit differently than you do, so you may spend a fair amount of time just sorting that part out. A bit of real life thrown in! At least this semester the groups remain the same from beginning to end.
