All I know is this would probably be an easy 2/5 during the regular semester. I only spent about 20 to 30 hours on the projects and about 6 to 8 hours of studying for exams. It's not a difficult course, and the readings can be interesting and informative, but I wouldn't bother watching the videos. Ended with a low A mostly because I couldn't get 100 on the first project, and I completely forgot to turn in one of the lesson quizzes (cost me about 1.5 grade points). I got approximately 80 on both exams.\n\nThe projects were lackluster for the most part. If you're good at leetcode you'll probably find the projects easy. They're less about knowing networking and more about knowing how to find an algorithm. The only one that I thought required some networking knowledge was the firewall. I'd have liked something along those lines for the other projects rather than \"here's a data structure, parse the data and return such and such values in this format\". FYI, you will spend at least 2 to 3 hours trying to understand what the project is asking of you.\n\nOverall, I thought the course was decent. Definitely not a great course, but I did learn some things from it so it wasn't a waste, but it could be better.",

In fact, I have been on the network engineering side of cybersecurity (think firewalls, switches, wireless, SIEM, etc.) for the last 10+ years.\n\nTL;DR: The course material, quizzes, and tests are on the easier side compared to other courses in the program. However, as someone who is not a software engineer, the projects took a lot of time.\n\nI decided to take this class because I thought it would be an easy \u2018A\u2019 given my background. While I did earn a high \u2018A\u2019 in the class, I spent an excessive amount of time on most of the projects due to the lack of clarity in the project requirements and the inclusion of some Python features I had not previously encountered. Additionally, I felt that having a professional network engineering background actually hindered me in this class, as there were multiple instances where topics were taught in a general sense, conflicting with real-world applications.\n\nRegarding the projects, they all have a Python component where you are given starter code and the answers, and you have to get your code/algorithm to produce the answers. At least one project (I took the class over the summer) requires the use of Mininet in addition to Python. Often, it was easier to troubleshoot your code by comparing your output to the answers rather than trying to get clarification on the written requirements. The projects make the class feel more geared towards someone who will work at Cisco (or a similar company) as a software engineer, as opposed to someone working in corporate IT, an IT reseller, an MSP/MSSP, IT consulting, etc.\n\nThe weekly course material and accompanying quizzes can be completed in 3-5 hours a week if you want to be thorough, or less if you want to skim through it. I wasn\u2019t a fan of much of the material. As someone with industry networking engineering experience, many of the topics aren\u2019t relevant to what I have encountered in the real world. One of the topics discussed a lot throughout the course is BGP, but even this topic feels geared towards research/academia rather than industry.\n\nMy favorite topic in the class was Internet censorship, although the research papers for this topic are getting dated (the Arab Spring article is over ten years old and the Great Firewall of China article was released about 20 years ago).\n\nThe good: The lecture transcriptions are high quality and make the module components of the class easy.\n\nThe bad: Quizzes and tests are mostly memorization of facts and graphs (as some others have said, in a somewhat \u201ctrivia\u201d fashion). Projects could use better documentation or some starter/\u201dlow-hanging fruit\u201d type introductory tasks (although the BGPStream projects felt more like this). ",

It felt like the professor was reading the instructions on the side of a pill bottle. None of the questions on the tests or quizzes seemed like it was anything but an exercise in memorizing trivia.\n\nOn the plus side, the subject matter of the class is basically how does the internet work, which feels relevant. The projects are much better than the lectures. While not difficult, they are reasonably fun and interesting. \n\nThe TA staff was very responsive and the way the class run was very low hassle. The workload is extremely light, maybe 1/2 the effort of ML4T. \n\nIf you are thinking of taking this class because it is easy, I would recommend either finding another easy class that is more engaging, or putting up with a slightly harder class to get a better educational experience. \n\nIf you want to actually learn anything about computer networks, and you must take this class, look for the series of lectures by Jim Kurose, who was one of the authors of the CN course textbook.\n\nPrevious classes : ML4T, RAIT, ML, DL",

You learn about the OSI model, common internet protocols, domain routing and router architecture, software defined networks, content delivery networks, BGP and a bit about security.\n\nThe content of the lectures are good, but the actual videos are extremely dry and boring. Definitely the worst lecture videos of any class I took in OMSCS. The saving grace is that there are written note versions of the lectures. After watching a couple videos, I ended up just reading the notes for the rest of the semester. \n\nThe weekly quizzes do a good job of preparing you for the two exams, although the exams were a little bit too trivia heavy for my liking. When I took the course there were 40 questions on the first exam and 50 on the second, all multiple choice.\n\nThere were 4 projects. In the first two, we implemented algorithms from the lectures: Spanning Tree Protocol and Distance Vector. These were fun and not very hard. The second two, SDN Firewall and BGP data analysis, were more tedious with less programming and more sifting through data.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t taken a networking class and want an easy summer class or double up course, I could recommend this class. Otherwise, you\u2019re fine skipping it. There are plenty of good networking resources online.",

                        "body": "## Summary\nThis class is a basic overview of networking topics that assumes little to no prior knowledge of the topics covered.\nOverall, the class is somewhere between bad and fair.  It's really more like a second or third year undergraduate course than like a graduate course.\n\nI ended the class with a high A and spent about 2-3 hours a week on average, but some weeks were more like 0.5-1.  I'd give this class a 1/5 for difficuly and a 2/5 for quality.\n\n### Background\nMath undergrad, this is my second/third class along with SDP.  I previously took GIOS.  I did no prep for this class and had basically no exposure to networking concepts, but had vast experience in Python.\n\n### Structure\n12 modules delivered via Canvas.  Weekly quizzes, 5 assignments, 2 exams (a midterm and a final).\n\n* Modules: primarily text-based with the occasional video.  Lectures are generally low quality and low effort.  You will have to consult third party resources to properly understand.  The second half of the course is much worse than the first in this regard.\n\n* Quizzes: not proctored and you are allowed to use anything.  They are a reading check and are straightforward.  I got a low A average on these.\n\n* Assignments: All in python, all very straightforward.  I don't think I spent over 10 hours on any of them and some of them were more like 2-3 hours while I sipped my morning coffee. I got 100s on all of them except for one where I made a dumb mistake and lost 5 points.\n\n* Exams: simple testing of surface-level concepts.  Sort of like a trivia contest, actually.  I got a 90 and 85 on these.  They aren't weighted very heavily at just 12% apiece.\n\n### The Good \n* TAs: they were fantastic!  I've never seen such a proactive and helpful TA team and doubt I will again.\n\n* Assignments were fun but not always super relevant.  If you're good at python they're super simple.\n\n### The Bad \n* Lecture quality.  What the hell were they thinking?  The lectures are insanely bad and need to be revamped.  Terms are introduced without any context or explanation, examples are sparse and everything reads like a notes someone took while watching actual lectures.  \n\n* Also the assignments.  They are sort of, kind of related to networking but are not designed in such a way that they encourage learning.\n\n* Quizzes are pointless and felt like busy work.\n\n### Advice\nSkip this class if you can and save one of your classes for something more interesting.  You would be better off just reading the textbook at your own leisure.\n\nIf you are going to take it, the only advice I have is to use Anki for spaced repetition.  This is basically the perfect class for it since it revolves around memorizing random facts.  Other than that this class could not be any easier.  If you can read English fluently and program in Python you will most likely get an A.  If you can't get an A in this course I would be seriously concerned about being able to finish the program.",

I also think this is the best medium for the professor as she's just not a very engaging presenter.  Overall, the teaching staff did a good job running the course. \n\nI enjoyed some projects, others weren't as fun, but the hints on Ed from the TAs always pointed me in the right direction.  If you complete all assignments and don't totally blow the exams its an easy A.  \n\nI've heard people say this isn't a graduate level course. I disagree; being easy does not mean it's not graduate level.  Sure, the first half of the course is the basics of networking, but the second half covers higher level topics, like efficiently utilizing CDNs and studying internet censorship.  These are graduate level topics in my opinion.\n\nOverall, if you are systems track taking this class is a no-brainer it fulfills a core requirement without much difficulty and let's you relax a semester, or pair with something more time consuming.  Overall good class, highly recommend.\n\nP.S. Took in Spring *2024*",

That is my very appretiate.\n\nThe course is more about the experiments and theortical answers. But each assignment's last part is about coding on C++. You would be better if you know some basic knowledge about the C++ coding otherwise will be more difficult.\n\nThe worst part about the coding is it doesnot have IDE. you only code on textbook. very sad for beginers. No easy way to debug the code. But good news is all coding line amended will be less than 100 lines. so no much code need to be added. \n\nexam will much more focus on the lectures. not hard but need to watch all lecture videos and practise the sample exams.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Ask for help from your fellow students in either EdStem or the Discord channel (unofficial, but usually a student starts one every term).\n\nThis class used to be completely different content altogether (used to be Udemy based) when I started with OMSCS, which is why I initially skipped it.

Took as my 5th course along with PUBP-8803 (6th).\n\nOverall, not a bad class for a non-CS background. Good intro to networking with projects that were challenging for someone of my experience, but not insurmountable. Usually took me 10-18hrs (2 days) on the weekend to finish a project, with the BGP Measurements assignment taking 3-4 days (this project on the VM takes forever to run and debug (15min per each task), which is infuriating when you aren't passing the checks; start this project early). Still, I got a 100 on all of the projects. \n\nThis likely means that if you have more experience than me, you'd find this course much easier. If you are like me, it's manageable, even with a separate writing course. \n\nLectures were dry and I wish that content was explained better. A lot is just reading text, with videos that barely provide amplifying information. Probably about 2-3 hours a week taking notes and trying to understand what's happening. Never got 100 on the quizzes because they are intentionally tricky. \n\nExams suck, but if you review the study guide in its entirety and look at all the modules' quizzes, you can get a B on the exams. Still, probably needed about 6-8hrs to review all of the above and take the test. A better understanding may get you that A, but idk.\n\nI understand how this course can be disliked, but I enjoyed it. It's not hard and pairable with another course, even for a novice like me."

The video lectures are also extremely boring and not well presented compared to other lecture videos that I have seen for other courses.\n\nThe weekly quizzes can be easily completed by searching through the modules as they are open notes. The assignments are basic and can be done over the weekends they are due. I spend about 30 minutes each week for the quizzes, 10 hours per assignment, and 24 hours for each exams.\n\nThis should not be labelled as a graduate level course at all, as the contents and depth of material is equivalent to a 200 level undergraduate course at a Top 10 CS university.

The assignments rarely took me more than a few nights with some being done in a single night. Some of them were cool while others were pretty boring.

I little more detail...\n\nProjects: By the end of it, I think all but one of the projects were actually quite interesting. The problem, however, is that they are poorly explained. I truly spent more time deciphering what exactly we were supposed to be doing than actually doing it. There are important details that aren't explained, and as usual, rude TA's. That being said, once you got a handle on the intent/purpose, the projects were really pretty cool.\n\nQuizzes: Fine. Whatever. It's a reading check.\n\nLectures: Miserable. Mostly reading (a few videos that are just reading the text) and poorly explained. I read several sections over and over asking \"What on Earth are they saying.\"\n\nExams: Also miserable. There is SO much content. One person on Ed said \"I feel like I'm memorizing an encyclopedia.\" That's exactly right. Boring lectures that feel like you're just reading countless independent facts. Most of the exam questions are simple and just rote memorization. Some are intentionally tricky, which is one of my pet peeves in any course. But don't let that fool you into thinking the exams are \"easy\". It's hard memorizing an encyclopedia!",

Rather than encouraging a deep dive into the subject matter, the exams appeared to prioritize an accumulation of obscure facts, minor details, and information not central to the subject.

If you actually wanna learn, you have to really teach yourself useful information, which is normal for a grad school class, but when the class is so insanely easy there is no reason to push deeper into the material. Comparing the lectures to other classes like RL, ML, ML4T, or GIOS, you wonder what you even paid tuition for. \n\nThe projects are basically just leetcode questions that are sort of related to networking. First two were kinda easy, but the last two were decent. \n\nExams are fair so no complaints there. I actually think those are the best part because to get an A on them, you do actually need to learn the material.\n\nI think this class is good for two people, 1) people who don't know anything about computers, and 2) people who just want an easy A. I'm getting married this month so I needed an easy course. I really wanted to learn this material as its really relevant to my job but I just couldn't do it in this class, there was no reason to try and the lectures were so dry.\n\nJust redo the lectures please and make them on par with classes like GIOS, RL, or ML4T, keep the current assignments and you'd have a top tier class. In it's current state, I would not recommend this class for anyone trying to actually learn. I also think that making the exam a larger percentage of the grade might force students to actually study and learn instead of just letting the projects carry their grade.\n\nStaff including the professor all seemed nice but honestly I barely even looked at Ed the entire semester.

I personally found it a bit hard to understand the lecture because professor's accent, but they provided the text format in each module.  all research papers are optional if you want to get in-depth on certain topics. \n\nThe assignments:\nThere was a ton of information for each assignment(presentation, walkthrough video, and thorough description), the few times I felt lost or ambiguous statement is because I missed some portion of the description. Gradescope is a huge plus, TAs are very responsive to questions.\n\nThe exam:\nI think the exam is very well designed, they are not too easy, not too hard, no tricky questions. you can get easily 75-85% just going through the lectures. but to get 100% you really need to study and get understand very well each of the concepts",

None of the labs were large programming assignments; but meant instead to emphasize aspect of network design, simulation, or security.  These were of moderate difficulty.\nThe weekly quizzes were open note, and naturally straightforward.  Since the material in the slides was the same as the short video lectures, I just read the slides.  The exams were tricky and I did study for them to get As, but these were a lesser percent of the overall grade.  The Ed Discussion was helpful, there were weekly office hours and though I couldn't catch them live, I did listen to the recordings.  So TAs were on the ball as much as in any other class I've had in the program (thisis class #3)\n\nMy only nit is that we didn't get very in depth in any one area.  But then, I only read the paper on consistent hashing; so maybe the papers was where the depth would've come from. ",

The notes here on OMS Central were good to use to get ahead of the power curve. The projects were very well documented, and the pacing was good for a course like this. This was a very good second course.

Some TAs on Ed talk in this cryptic and unhelpful way when answering questions (which I find lots of TAs in other classes do as well). I got this feeling that they feel obligated to reply to certain posts, but they either refuse to understand the original question or don't want to \"make it too easy\". They somehow manage to type a whole sentence without providing any useful information. They reply to your question by asking more questions. The stupid thing about this approach is that figuring out the answer to those artificial questions oftentimes won't get you any closer to the simple answer that you were looking for. If they talk like that on StackOverflow they'll be downvoted into oblivion for sure. \nOverall I feel like I don't get much out of this class. At least it wasn't too painful if you just avoid Ed. ",

The slack is very active as well. The assignments aren't too bad and can be completed with 2-3 days of work. Though the last assignment took a bit longer than usual. The assignments documentation is about 15-20 pages at times which is kind of annoying. Quizzes are straight forward and can be done under 15 minutes with Ctrl-F. The things I hated about this class were the lectures, they were SOO dry and just a wall of text. The midterm wasn't too bad but the final was really hard and it really caused a lot of people's grade to drop. Overall it was a good course and highly recommend as a first class.",

Not many videos in this class, it's a lot of reading, again, dry content.\n\nThe exams were pretty difficult and you had memorize a lot of dry material  and answer tricky gotcha questions. \n\nThe last project, BGP Measurements was a complete mess, unorganized and you had to spend days to understand what they want you to do. The TA had a really crappy behavior when you ask a question and never helped much when I opened an Ed thread. Not much info on the PyBGPStream library.\n\nThe other projects were not bad and they were not \"easy\" by any means.

That can be re-written in a couple of short pages.\n\nOverall I feel like I wasted a whole semester with this class. I didn't learn much from it and whatever I learned won't help me with my career. "

There's a heavy emphasis on using the correct data structures for projects. You'll be using Mininet for Software Defined Networking projects, so it's a good idea to do the warm-up exercise even though it's not graded. Always start projects early and read through the project documentation sometimes twice. I thought the material was good since it goes into the core of the Internet and makes you appreciate that it works without much issue. There are also extra credit opportunities that can give you a buffer towards the end of the semester. The quizzes are open book/open note, and I would encourage you to take advantage of that.\n\nThe not so good: I felt like some of the questions on quizzes and exams are gotcha questions mostly around True/False questions. This may be since some of the quiz questions are gathered from students (see extra credit opportunities). The material is mostly text with only a handful of lecture videos that are usually less than 5 minutes in length. Beware: this is a mostly TA-driven class. The professor hosts two office hours before the midterm and final exams to go over quiz answers and questions students may have, but there isn't much interaction with her throughout the semester. The exams are tough and are mostly around memorizing material and regurgitating it in the form of True/False, multiple choice, and multiple selection answers. I'm not a fan of that, but you may be, so YMMV.\n\nTL;DR, I liked the course mostly because of the projects. You'll learn that this is certainly a theory course with implementation through projects. Most of this course is going to be focused on the Internet core and Software Defined Networking (SDN).

FWIW: It's not about your home networking set-up, it's about the backbone of the internet -- you'll see how it all works behind the scenes. The TAs were outstanding, and the Slack was active; it can be paired with another course in SPR/FALL. I didn't leave this course learning much, but the routing and SDN lectures were the best. I wish the SDN project had more to it to show what SDN is capable of.\n\nThe other parts of the class did not interest me at all, getting through these lectures was tough. There are a lot of concepts to memorize that I'll never use and were irritating having to remember. I spent roughly 25-30 hours a week on this in summer so my time will be slightly higher than a normal semester. I appreciate they allowed plenty of time for projects, exams, and offered extra credit.",

The breadth of course, and the exposure to cutting edge research in the field, has been very good in getting to understand the field and where it is going. Some of the course material including SDN, Audio/Video performance would have taken a lot of work to understand without the course.\n\nThe teaching staff including the professor were very helpful in the course. The assignments are fairly straightforward if you spend time beforehand to understand the material. The assignments helps the material stick with you. If you spend sufficient time on the assignments, read through discussion threads and try out extra test scenarios, it should be possible to get full points on it. I did not do the extra credit assignment, but it seems to be an extension of the BGP measurements project.\n\nThe mechanism of having weekly quiz and two exams were good in reinforcing the material. I really wanted to learn the material, and this structure helped me. If you go through the material, it should be possible to score well on quiz and exams as well.\n\nThe workload of the course is not high, and if motivated, can be paired with a similar difficulty course, without undue stress.\n\nOverall a very well done course, if you are interested in the material\n",

This is an easy course and a great one to pair with a medium/hard course. The projects are fun and you get enough time for each on them. I am not sure what changed from past semesters, but I felt the project organization and instructions were pretty straight forward. It took me couple of hours to understand the project requirements/go over concepts and a few more to code. The lectures covered interesting concepts but yes as mentioned before it involved more reading which as times I did not enjoy. Exams are also great and easy if you get a good grasp of concepts, and the quizzes are really helpful for that. Although, I did feel some of the questions were poorly worded and created some ambiguity. Overall its an easy course and you can get an A with good efforts in the projects and exams. ",

Third course in the program for me, almost 2 years of professional SWE experience, and a limited foundational educational background in CS. I had zero networking experience or knowledge prior to this course, but am walking out of it thinking that I could at least hold a semi-intelligent conversation with a networking/cloud engineer now. And honestly in reflection, I thoroughly enjoyed it along the way. \n\nThe TA's were absolutely incredible, particularly Erick. He basically saved the BGP Measurements project by putting in a lot of effort into an autograding script and being so responsive on Slack and Ed. Reviews from last semester made this project seem like a bit of a dumpster fire, but I think that it ended up being my favorite of the five projects. It was purely code based this semester and the script made it easy to verify results.  \n\nThe first two projects are very straightforward graph traversal type algorithmic problems that should be easy with a little Python knowledge. The last three projects, however, get a bit trickier. Instructions are long and confusing at first glance, but it's primarily due to just having to explain how things like Mininet work and describing what they wanted. I thought the last three projects were wonderful once you understood what they were asking you to do-- perfect mix of mildly challenging, extremely educational, and pretty fun in my opinion.  \n\nWeekly quizzes are open note and have a 30 minute window to complete them. Thankfully more than enough time to control-F through the blocks of text in the lesson to find what you're looking for most of the time. I found the tests to be trickier extrapolations of these quizzes and more edge case type questions, but overall, quite reasonable. The lecture content is long and networking is not as sexy of a topic as something like machine learning is but you really don't need to dive into it much to do well. \n\nTL;DR: if you don't have a lot of networking experience but want to learn more (at least at the basic level), take the course. You won't regret it. ",

I've been working professionally as a Sysadmin, SRE, and now a cloud architect and I still got a lot out of this class. I know there are complaints about this class, especially with some confusion about the final project in the past, but I will tell you that all of the projects this semester went smoothly. \n\nI thought Prof Konte's lectures were great and the TAs are quick to answer questions in EdStem and Slack. I didn't really have to interact with any of them, but as someone who would lurk for responses from time to time, it was easy to find info that answered my questions.\n\nThe workload is fair, It revolves around a weekly quiz and projects with a couple of exams mixed in. You will see some people complain about the material being dry, but I didn't find that to be true at all. There is a lot of supplemental white papers in this class, and I read through most of them as I went. If you approach this as an academic exploration of the history and architecture of computer networks, and not some udemy bootcamp on networks, you'll be much happier in this class.\n\nI made an A in this class, and I can share my strategy for doing so. \n\nProjects are 66% of your grade. I made 100% on all of the other projects. None of them were particularly difficult, but there were conceptual challenges that you do have to solve. You have to put in the time to get these right, but they are all very manageable.  I felt the projects complimented the material well and I have a much better understanding of SDN and BGP because of it.\n\n- All projects have either an autograder or a tool to check your work, use them.\n- Start on the projects early. \n- Read and reread the work expected of you before writing any code (seriously, this is important, don't just start coding, you will get tangled up and frustrated... but this goes for all proper engineering)\n- I would typically scaffold out what I thought about doing in comments before writing any real code.\n- review the checker tool source code and the solution files for context. this helps a lot in sorting out what is expected.\n- Write your code in a way that its easy to test your hypothesis as you go. A lot of these projects are about exploring concepts or analyzing data streams. If you poorly structure your code or get too fancy with abstraction you will be sad. be practical. hack the planet.\n\nI put a light amount of effort into quizes. They are open book, but with a 30 minute cap. There are fantastic student built notes for the class, use them. I averaged an 86% on the quizes, but it really doesn't matter. I plowed through them and spent as little time thinking about them as possible. Put your effort into the projects.\n\nI made an 83% on exam 1 and a 93.5% on exam 2. I put in the same level of effort on both, which was that I read through my notes (and the student notes) and I reviewed the quizes. I guess I just had a better day on exam 2. Exam 2 is not cumulative, which is nice. Exams are not open book and they use HonorLock. C'est La Vie. \n\nThere is a bonus that is worth 3%, but they only grade it if you are on the cusp of another letter grade. I can't comment on the bonus, I didn't do it.\n\nI found out my final project grade after taking the final exam, but I felt pretty confident about scoring as well as I did on the others.\n\nI'd recommend this class for anyone who wants to know more about how the architecture of the internet works. It does a good job of breaking down the evolution and design choices made along the way and the projects reflect that as well. I'd take this class again and I think it's worthwhile for anyone in the program who wants a deeper understanding of how networks work.",

There are no lectures videos everything is just a wall of notes. Quizzes can have a *gotcha* answer in there. The content is dry and TA's don't know what they're doing sometimes. Syllabus says last submitted assignment will be picked after deadline, but gradescope lets you pick the one you want to submit, but this does not apply for assignments that have to be submitted on canvas. Some quizzes get extended by 2-3 weeks but there's only a 1 day extension for some assignments? Some assignments have clearly marked out criteria to get grades (autograder) that you can use but others don't have that, so you're left guessing about your grade.\nThere's not explanation added for this.\nProjects (1 is not graded) 2 and 3 were real easy. But SDN was such a pain to deal with, the actual project is not that hard, and the sheer amount of material given to you in order to complete the project just overwhelms you. The intention is to help you, but it honestly had the opposite effect for me (and some others as well admittedly.)\nBGP Hijacking was not that hard.\n\nI will update this back when I finish the final project.\nI'm a cloud engineer and honestly 2-3 weeks of messing around on AWS, youtube and udemy can teach you more practical networking than this excuse of a class. \n\nI would not recommend this to anyone who wants to learn practical networking, or get a decent grade.

I understand abstractions pretty well, and get irritated by tedium, so it was nice to have some of the details obfuscated and removed from the lectures/projects. I'm not a network engineer and I don't intend to get into that sort of work- but I come across the concepts often enough as a Systems Engineer (in HW R&D) where I feel knowing the concepts is worthwhile.\n\nThe projects started more difficult, but ended more confusing. Towards the end I think there were some heavy modifications to semesters previous, and the details had not yet been fully worked out. Nonetheless, it wasn't that bad and I was able to finish the projects pretty comfortably without headache.\n\nLectures are fairly simple, and quizzes are easy. There's the odd question or 2 that feel tricky and difficult, but for the most part the answers correspond directly to the notes provided. I didn't find the videos helpful (skipped them), since they were essentially read word for word from the lectures anyway. For me, I had ongoing notes based on the study guide questions where I'd rephrase the instructor notes for my own understanding. This strategy got me high 90s on the exams (which are really similar to the quizzes) and a 96% for the class (an A)",

My overall impression is that this is a low quality course (compared to others in OMSCS) that is only worth it if you need an easy A (and it was an easy A for me).\n\nPositives:\n\n * I found some modules to be interesting (like SDN).\n * Exams are easy.\n\nNeutral:\n\n * It's not a challenging course. \n * Assignments (except the last one) had a very detailed documentation and even videos.  \n * Weekly quizzes are based on lectures. I found them to be relatively easy. Sometimes you can even guess the right answer based on the context. \n\nNegatives:\n\n * I don't think I learned a lot in this course, although it definitely wasn't completely worthless. Just not what I would expect from a graduate course.\n * Course material presentation is horrible. Lectures are literally just a wall of text.\n * Lecture materials need proofreading. English is not my first language, but some of the mistakes are very noticeable and that is definitely not the quality I expected from Georgia Tech.\n * I felt like people were asking too many simple programming questions on Ed - about debugging, using python structures, etc. I also completely agree with the review from \"11/21/2021\" that starts with \"Having taken classes\"... Take a look at the post that they quoted. Reading all the threads on Ed, I got an impression that some people expect to have all the test cases available to them upfront. What would be the point of that? You need to learn to analyze your results, not just run the test cases blindly. So I didn't feel like there were many interesting discussions happening on Ed.\n\nHonestly, I don't think that this was worth the money. I wish some of the topics were covered better. I have mistakenly assumed that since this is a graduate level course I'll definitely learn something from it, but to me it seemed more like an introduction to networking. Well, going forward, I'll  read these reviews more carefully. ",

                        "body": "Let me just start of with the most recent impression... the last project sucks. Just sucks. It's the worst thing ever. Period. The course was going really well up until that point... and the final project just sank it.\n\nLet's start with the course material... if you took an undergrad CN course like I did, this is pretty much a refresher on that with a few more interesting details sprinkled on top. As far as I understand, pretty much all CN courses everywhere on the planet follow the same Kurose & Ross textbook, so if you've read and understood that textbook, congratulations, you passed this course.\n\nThere are some more advanced topics covered that are seemingly from the professor's exact field of interest, like the security and event measurement stuff, which was kind of neat to learn about. Also, the lectures get a way more enthusiastic tone at that point in the course, which is a nice contrast to the bland text and the even blander professor's voice reading that text, which is a kind of an overarching theme for the rest of the course.\n\nOh yeah, the lectures are pretty crappy and poorly made. Only like 30% of the segments have actual video, the rest is just a wall of text with a few very non-illustrative pictures. And the videos are also accompanied by a wall of text, and the professor simply reads that wall of text very slowly. To be honest, while I was a bit put off by all that at first, I later started to appreciate the fact that I could just skip all the videos, skim over the wall of text and get pretty much all the required knowledge.\n\nThe projects are nice and simple, each one is a short Python-based thingamajig that implements some concept from the lectures without requiring too much work. No autograder, though... But the TAs seem to be very lenient about grading the projects\n\nExcept the last project. Holy mother of crappy projects, that was something to behold. What was so bad about it? Well... are you sitting down? Yes? Ok, here we go: *The TAs CHANGED THE PROJECT INSTRUCTIONS AND REQUIREMENTS HALFWAY INTO THE PROJECT PERIOD*. Also, while the TAs and the professor were pretty helpful during the rest of the course, they simply screwed over every student who didn't procrastinate on the project, wrote a half-assed apology, refused to extend the deadline, and went quiet.\n\nThe last project was also the only one that required interaction with a slightly poorly-documented API, making it a bit more of a hassle than the rest of the projects. But... forcing the students to do the project twice just because the TAs had a change of mind halfway through? WTF?\n\nThe exams were mostly a collection of the in-lecture quizzes, which covered the topics presented quite well. Some of the exam questions were literally the same as on the quizzes, some were the same question but with different numbers or an inverted answer just to test if you're paying attention, and there was a small number of unique questions that weren't too bad. The exam results are also instantly available, so that's good.\n\nOverall, this course didn't stress me out too much (except the last project), and it was a nice refresher on a topic I already knew something about. There are certainly aspects that could be improved, like the lectures, but overall it's a decent course. Except for the final project, that is. It really pissed me (and everyone else) off. For this reason I'm rating it Neutral instead of Liked, since I can't bring myself to say I \"liked\" anything about the last project or the TAs that handled the last project.",

                        "body": "**Requirements**: You need not require too much of prior preparation for this course specific to networking, however a bit of Python knowledge is recommended. If you are used to programming in the past, you can pick up the projects quickly. Understanding on Python APIs, data structures will be an advantage for some of the projects.\n\n**My background and Takeaway**: This is my first OMSCS course. Though I had studied Networking in my Under Graduation, it\u2019s been more than 10 years. So, this course refreshed my knowledge on Networking. I had 8 years of programming experience in Mainframe and did a Python course before joining OMSCS. I am glad that I took this easy course as my first to make me feel less stressful and to get comfortable with the student environment and applications. On weeks without assignment deadline, I spent about 8 hours and during difficult projects I spent about 3 to 5 days. \n\n**Lectures and Exams/Quizzes**: Lectures are pretty straight forward and had also additional optional resources to gain in depth knowledge on the subject. There are 2 proctored exams. If you thoroughly go through the course contents and the weekly quizzes, you can crack them. The weekly quizzes were initially proctored (first 2), then changed to open book which reduced the stress for the students.\n\n**Assignments**: \nThere were totally 7 projects including optional and extra credits. The instructions and the expectations were very clear for the assignments (exception BGPM). If you follow the EdStem posts during the projects, you can finish them easily. The respective TAs were active in Ed and conducted chat sessions to help you clarify things. Going through the documents and the walkthrough videos linked in the project requirements helps you with better understanding and to complete the projects on time.\n\nOptional **Simulating Networks** project and the first 2 projects to implement **Spanning Tree Protocol** and **Distance Vector algorithms** were easy. To be frank, I did start working on them only the last 2 days before the deadline. Make sure to test your code against student provided test cases to fix any unexpected results.\n\nThe project **SDN Firewall** requires you to implement several firewall rules using POX. Please start working on this project very early as you might have a lot of clarifications to be made on the requirements. I started working on this project one week after it was opened and had to put extra efforts to understand the use of Python APIs and the use of MAC/IPv4 addresses/ports. The project TA Jeffrey had wonderful knowledge on the subject and was extremely helpful. Though I thoroughly tested the code, there were some surprises on the auto grader and got a few failed test cases. Wish I had started early on this one.\n\nHere comes the difficult of all, the **BGP Measurements (BGPM)** project. There were several tasks to be completed to plot graphs on the routing information collected. If you are new to Python, you will certainly learn the best usage of data structures and APIs. You will have to start this project as soon as it opens up. We could never complete this in a weekend. This is because initially the project asked us to use Jupyter Notebook, then we were asked to code without it. The requirements were not that clear as they were for the previous projects. There were no walkthrough videos. The project TAs also could not help much with the requirements. The lecturer Dr.Konte had to jump in to clarify the Ed posts by students. A lot of chaos on Ed as the understanding kept changing after lecturer\u2019s clarifications. Make sure you thoroughly go through the documents and the Ed posts to finish this project. Luckily this helped me complete this project just before the deadline.\n\n**Extra credits project IWEEC** requires you to take some famous internet incidents around the world, collect related data and plot a graph. If you understand the requirements and the usage of data, you can find a knack.\n\nFor Fall, we had an extra assignment **BGP Hijacking** which was to simulate a hijacking scenario and it was relatively easy compared to SDN and BGPM. \n\n**For future students**: You can easily secure an \u2018A\u2019 if you satisfy the requirements and start on the difficult projects as soon as they are opened. This course can be combined with another course during Spring or Fall. Will be a stress-free course for Summer as well. \n\n**All the Best!**",

While background in networking is recommended, I didn\u2019t need it to understand or succeed in the course. \n\nMajority of the work comes from the class projects and exams. Class Projects were well-written and TAs provided support in a timely manner. The exception to this being BGP Measurements project which involved using an API to analyze BGP data and develop key insights from. I suspect it is in the prototyping phase, as the project lacked the same support and transparency as the other projects. \n\nExams were essentially rote memorization of the material presented in lecture slides/canvas modules.

                        "body": "**Background:** This is my first semester in OMSCS and I took this at the same time as another course. I have a BS in a (non-CS) STEM field and am not currently working in a capacity of or related to a SWE. However, I have used Python and several other programming languages extensively for the past several years for coursework, research, jobs/internships, and personal projects, so I consider myself to possess at least an intermediate proficiency with Python. I took this course because I want to become a Data Engineer and believe that having formal education regarding Computer Networks is essential for achieving that outcome. With that being said, I both knew nothing about Computer Networks and did not attempt to study any of the \u201cprerequisite\u201d material before the semester started.\n\n**Lectures:** The content that this course attempts to cover is vast in its scope but ultimately successful in exposing students to many fundamental networking topics/concepts. The lessons provide a mixture of high-level and low-level details for each topic, as well as resources at the bottom of each page for you to read more about \u2018x\u2019 topic. Each lesson primarily consists of walls of text that students must navigate through with the occasional supplemental video thrown in here and there. I do not understand how some students flew through the weekly lectures, as I found them to be fairly dense. I am a slow reader at baseline, but I had taken ~150 pages of notes in a word document by the end of the course. Despite knowing that most other students are way faster readers than I am, I believe that most students take the lectures less seriously because of both the open-book nature of the weekly quizzes and the reputation that this class has for being \u201ceasy.\u201d\n\nI have two primary gripes with the lectures. Firstly, I found the lecture *videos* worthless because they exclusively consisted of Dr. Konte reading an adjoining wall of text located just under the video player verbatim. However, my bigger issue was that the *written* lecture content was consistently riddled with syntactical and grammatical errors, respectively. These errors crippled the flow of certain content sections and made an already dry, abstract topic even more arduous to comprehend. A simple fix would be to have one of the TAs throw each wall of text into Grammarly to correct such errors.\n\nAs an aside, this class has an optional textbook that is meant to supplement the lecture content. I did not feel the need to read it, but other students have mentioned that it does a better job of covering some of the lecture content. If you find yourself unhappy with the lectures, this might be an effective alternative, but know that I did not find it mandatory to read anything more than the lecture notes to do well on the quizzes/exams, which I discuss below.\n\n**Quizzes:** There were weekly quizzes that started out as closed-book at the beginning of the semester, but Dr. Konte reverted to open-book quizzes starting with Quiz #3 to reduce student stress levels. I believe that going back to an open-book policy was fair because many of the quiz questions tend to ask about extremely low-level details rather than gauging general understanding regarding a topic. My quiz grades were consistently >90% both before and after the policy change, only missing questions occasionally due to some ambiguous wording or the rare question genuinely being tricky.\n\n**Exams:** This class only has a Midterm and Final, the latter not being cumulative. I believe that most people found the Midterm more difficult than the Final, but the average score for both hovered around the mid-80s. I scored >90% on each exam and felt that the questions asked were overall quite fair. The questions on each exam definitely took their cues from the study guide, but I would argue that the Midterm strayed from said guide a bit more. In any case, the study guide (given to you on the first day of the course) will serve you extremely well as a foundation for studying for exams in this class.\n\n**Projects (Overview):** This semester consisted of five required projects and two optional projects, one of which was an (ungraded) warmup while the other was for extra credit. We were given 2 weeks to complete each project, which was reasonable. The projects cumulatively account for a vast majority of your grade, so it is imperative that you pretty much ace each of these if you are trying to secure an A. I got 100% on each of them.\n\n**Project #0 (Mininet):** A warmup that requires you to recreate several network topologies using Mininet. This project is optional and ungraded, but it takes no more than a couple of hours to do and provides a fine introduction to Mininet. I found that this warmup was helpful for at least one project later in the course because it gave me some Mininet exposure, so I would recommend doing it.\n\n**Project #1 (Spanning Tree Protocol):** A project that requires you to implement the Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) from (relative) scratch. This project took me about 40 hours to finish, which apparently is well above the norm (i.e., you will likely finish this project faster than I did). This project had an excellent walkthrough that made it very clear what you had to do to implement the algorithm. However, I found that the STP portion of the lecture content was way more helpful in showing me how to derive a working implementation. I would say to use both of these resources in tandem and the student test suite to verify the accuracy of your implementation. I honestly felt like I accomplished something of note by the end of this project, despite the handholding in the form of the walkthrough video/test suite.\n\n**Project #2 (Distance Vector):** A project that requires you to implement the Distance Vector (DV) Routing Protocol from (relative) scratch. This project also had an excellent walkthrough that made it transparent what you had to do to implement the algorithm. This project is overwhelmingly similar to the first project, which makes this one much easier and less rewarding by extension. As proof of this, this project took me roughly 20 hours to complete fully (i.e., half of the time that it took me to complete the STP project). I honestly think that the respective STP and DV projects should be combined into one project given their similarity, allowing for the creation of another project that can be used to reinforce course content. Perhaps a project focusing on implementing Dijkstra\u2019s Algorithm? \n\n**Project #3 (SDN):** A project that requires you to build a firewall using POX and then implement a bunch of firewall rules. After figuring out what we were being asked for, this project took me about 10 hours to complete. The problem with the project has nothing to do with the actual project and everything to do with both the convoluted assignment description and POX\u2019s poor API documentation. Reworking the assignment description by chopping out redundant/unnecessary content (i.e., most of the description\u2019s appendix) is essential here so that what students derive from this experience is focused on seeing how an OpenFlow controller works in action. Quite a few students \u201cleft\u201d the Slack channel for this class by the time the due date rolled around. Therefore, one can hypothesize that a non-negligible number of students were unable to complete this project on time in part due to the convoluted project description and thus had to drop the class. However, a saving grace for this assignment was the project TA, Jeffrey. I have never seen a TA as responsive and ready to help out students at the drop of a hat as this guy. He was always on EdStem, even into the early AMs, and was keen on trying to alleviate ambiguities as he was able to. Give that man a medal. \n\n**Project #4 (BGP Hijacking):** A project that requires you to implement a BGP prefix hijacking scenario. This project took me about 10 hours to complete, and a vast majority of that time was spent fighting with LucidCharts to make a diagram. It really just requires you to recreate a network topology from a paper, modify adjoining configuration files, and implement the topology you created in code. This project had a walkthrough that was very effective and effectively answered virtually all student questions in advance. In my opinion, this was the easiest project in the class, yet also my favorite. I found that doing the optional Mininet warmup (i.e., Project #0) helped me understand what was going on here since this project relies heavily on Mininet as a dependency. The TA for this project, Erick, was also a rockstar.\n\n**Project #5 (BGP Measurements):** A project that requires you to extract data contained within rib/update files to compute descriptive statistics and/or generate data visualizations. This project took me about 45 hours to finish. The Jupyter Notebook requirement was dropped for this semester because everyone kept complaining about it during previous semesters. Despite being able to use an IDE of one\u2019s own choice, the hardest part about this project is knowing what the autograder is expecting the output of each function call to look like. This ambiguity was in part due to the ambiguous descriptions in the project documentation, but even more so because the project TAs were virtually non-existent. At least 100 unique questions went unanswered on EdStem this semester. Dr. Konte stepped in at the zeroth hour to answer several of the outstanding EdStem questions, but students should not have to wait until a couple of days before a project is due to get answers to some questions asked at least a week earlier. Frankly, the TA team should be ashamed about how they handled this project.\n\nThe actual coding required to implement the project requirements is not bad at all, but mandates competency with Python data structures and the pybgpstream/matplotlib libraries. I strongly recommend that those who are unfamiliar with any of these areas to study up on them before the class even starts to reduce the effort needed to complete this project. A surprising number of students were straight-up begging for extensions for this project, which was embarrassing and made all students in this class look particularly low-quality. You will be able to complete this project competently, or at least not have to beg Dr. Konte for an extension, if you get comfortable with the areas that I listed at the beginning of this paragraph.\n\nOf note, this project did not involve any test suite made available to students as was done for the first few projects. This contributed to the anxiety experienced by many of the students, but one of the TAs mentioned that this project will have a Gradescope runner available as early as next semester (i.e., Spring 2022). If that happens, I think that future students will have a much easier time with this project. However, if it does not happen, be ready to rely on asking questions through Slack and sharing graphs on EdStem to validate your results.\n\n**Extra Credit (Internet Wide Events):** A project that is essentially a much easier version of the BGP Measurements project. Research an event that involved some sort of cyberattack, use pybgpstream to pull relevant routing data from that event, and create a data visualization using the pulled data. Honestly, this project was interesting, only took several hours, and was an easy way to snag some extra credit points (although I am not sure that I will need it). Of note, this project only gets graded if you have a grade \u201con the border\u201d between two letter grades.\n\n**Professor:** Dr. Konte was virtually non-existent for this class, sans several EdStem posts she made over the course of the semester. However, she hosted office hours or posted review videos before each exam and consistently had something valuable to say when she was present. I would like to encourage Dr. Konte to try and have more of a presence in the class.\n\n**Conclusion:** I am coming out of this course with a great deal of knowledge regarding Computer Networks and fully expect to receive an A, so part of me is glad that I took this course. Yes, the class has its pain points. However, addressing the problems related to lectures, the SDN/BGP Measurements projects, and Dr. Konte\u2019s presence in the class would go a long way in improving this class\u2019s quality. I believe that Dr. Konte cares about this class and will continue to work on improving it in the future.\n\nAs an aside, I almost felt like I was doing something morally wrong by taking this class because of its reputation for being relatively \u201ceasy.\u201d While I guess that this class will attract people who want an \"easier\" A, I think that this class is valuable and worth your time (even though I did not like it enough to \"like\" it, per se). One does not need to take 10 classes on par with the difficulty of ML/RL/DL, GA, Compilers, etc. to obtain a quality education, and thus others would be na\u00efve to think that only the \u201cweakest\u201d in OMSCS would opt to take this course. \n",

I come from a STEM background (EE) and I have a STEM job (CS/IT).\n\nNow that I am done with the course, I kind of have mixed feelings about it. There were moments in the course where I really enjoyed the content, the projects and then there were some where I was really frustrated as well. Overall, I felt that the course progressively got worse as the semester went on. This includes the lecture notes. Last few lectures felt more like a bunch of random copy paste statements bunched together (sometimes even as is from Wikipedia!). They can certainly do with improvement. There were repetitions, grammatical mistakes and references to things that weren't even explained at all.\n\nSame for the projects, the ones earlier in the semester were pretty good in terms of instructions and latter ones clearly need more iterations. \n\nFor context, I worked as a technical engineer for a SDN startup right after my bachelors, so I found all the projects to be easy, except the last one which wasn't really difficult but felt like it due to vague instructions. The instructors actually changed the project two days after announcing it. It was very frustrating to start over but in hindsight, I feel that jupyter notebooks would have made things worse so I am glad that they took that part out!\n\nI disliked the SDN project the most. I finished it in around 4 hours or so but the controller we were working with had many known bugs in it. \n\nI do not have a lot more to add about the other projects. My fellow classmates have summarized it pretty well in their earlier reviews.\n\nOne thing to add, I took network science last semester and disliked the 'notes' format because I felt everything was summarized too much. In this course, I did not mind it as much (probably because I had the relevant context + background). Meaning, you may find yourself reading the book or finding other resources from time to time if you are not familiar with networks and want to understand the material well.\n\nThe instructor was sporadically active (one office hour plus a few videos + answering concerns/questions about last project). TA team held office hours regularly but were not very responsive on EdStem in my experience (again, something that got worse as the semester rolled on). I asked around 12 questions during the semester (a few about lecture content and a few about project clarification), only got two responses. Classmates were awesome! Slack channel was lively and everyone helped each other both on Slack and EdStem without violating the academic integrity guidelines.\n\nPS: my time spent is higher than normal because I really like taking in depth notes (ended up with over 200 pages at the end of the semester!)",

                        "body": "#### Background\n\nThis was my first course in OMSCS, coming from a non-CS undergrad (STEM degree).  I had no exposure to Networks prior to taking this course, so I did learn some things.  The only thing I am still waiting on is grade for the 5th project BGPM, so final grade still up in the air.  I ultimately expect an A in the course, but you never know with that project.\n\n#### Lectures\n\nThe lectures are as dry as they come, albeit you will learn something from them.  I skipped the videos (not that many) since it was more helpful to just read the text.  Some weeks are densely packed with information and it can be overwhelming.  Just understand the general concepts and you should be fine.\n\n#### Quizzes (10% of grade)\n\nOpen book and (usually) straight out of the lecture notes.  The weekly quizzes are pretty easy to handle, but some of the questioning is vague and a little misleading.  I ended up with around 93-94% of the quiz points as there are always a few questions here and there that can trip you up.\n\n#### Exams (Midterm 12%, Final 12%)\n\nExams are just an extension of the quizzes based on the same lecture notes.  Final is not cumulative, but there is still plenty of dense information to cover preparing for these exams.  Use the weekly quizzes as main source of studying for the exams.\n\n#### Projects (66% of grade)\n\n##### P1 Spanning Tree Protocol\n\nThis was actually the only project I lost points on (pending BGPM grades).  It is a relatively straightforward and algorithm based problem.  I vastly under-estimated the robustness of my code on this and it cost me.  It was a wake up call to get my butt in gear for the remaining projects.  I DIDN'T USE THE TEST SUITE - PLEASE USE THE STUDENT TEST SUITE TO TEST YOUR SOLUTION!\n\n##### P2 Distance Vector\n\nVery similar to P1 in terms of scope and type of solution needed.  I found this one to be easier than P1.  I do believe I was a little more prepared for this one, and was more thorough reading through the documentation and watching the tutorial video. \n\n##### P3 SDN Firewall\n\nWhat is seemingly an easy assignment turned out to be much more of a headache.  The TA describing the project said \"the solution is really simple, don't overthink it.\"  The difficulty however was sifting through the pages and pages of documentation, which often contained straight cut and paste copies of the OpenFlow API docs with a few added vague comments.  The documentation felt a little cumbersome yet lazy.  Once you \"get it\" though, the solution isn't a ton of work and there is a good student test suite to compare against.\n\n##### P4 BGP Hijacking\n\nThis was my favorite project and probably the one that took me the least amount of time.  Very well written documentation, and the tutorial video is great.  Fun solution to implement and see the results of.\n\n##### P5 BGP Measurements\n\nThe big kahuna.  A real dividing point in this class in terms of how students rate the overall course.  This one was a lot of work (maybe 50 hours?), and many of the problems are a little open ended.  I don't mind the open ended nature, but was frustrated with the lack of simple clarifications that should be specified in the documentation.  The TAs were pretty much nonexistent on EdStem during this project.  Professor Konte stepped in and gave a few clarifying points which was much appreciated.\n\nThis projected moved away from Jupyter Notebooks for this semester (albeit in a controversial manner 2 days after the first initial release).  I believe this will help move the project in a better direction for future semesters.  It really could be a great project, and requires the rigor one should expect out of a MS program from GaTech.  I hope they update the documentation a little to clarify a few simple yet crucial items required for the project that SHOULD be clarified.\n\n#### Other Comments\n\nOther than the lack of presence during the BGPM project, the TAs were pretty good for this course.  Shout out to Erick for his very timely responses on the Slack channel.  Professor Konte does an OH session prior to each exam, but had to switch it up for the final since she was ill.  Her responses on EdStem during BGPM really helped me.\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nA good course that certainly isn't perfect.  Lectures are dry and can be a lot to handle.  If you've taken a networking course you may not get a ton out of this class, but worth it if you haven't.  Projects are the majority of the grade and are definitely the highlight of the course.  Overall a good introduction into the OMSCS program.\n\n",

I can understand the negative comments about this course which are mostly true (dry lectures, ambiguous last project etc.). However, I still liked the course very much as it did a solid job of giving me a thorough understanding of computer networks. As someone having absolutely zero background in this area I am thankful for making me interested in this field and I am now considering taking some network security related courses to gain expertise in this fascinating area.",

There's no autograder for most, but it's still possible to get 100% by just watching the video and following instructions. That was harder for BGPM because the instructions weren't clear and were changed after it started.\n\nThe lectures are as dry as the Sahara.

It has the information you need, but it's just not very engaging and it feels like a slog when there's 20+ screens each week.\n\nI didn't look at a single one of the readings and I'm still on course for an A on every assignment and exam so far.

                        "body": "I do not have a CS background and this is my first course in the program. Workload is not consistent and depends on if there is a project. Weeks where there are only modules there is minimal work.\n\nGrade weights: Quizzes total 10%, exams are 12% each, projects are 8%, 14%, 14%, 15%, 15% respectively.\n\nModules/exams \u2013 it is pretty established that the lectures and notes can be a bit dry. I found the first half of the semester to be more interesting as the concepts were more tangible. I learned a good amount due to my non-CS background but it wasn\u2019t that exciting. With open note quizzes, if you really just want to get through the week you could probably do all of the modules and weekly quiz in 1.5 hours or less. If you want to go through the material to take something away from the class it might take another 1-1.5 hours. Average grade on each quiz is very close to full marks. Quizzes are open note and take a lot of verbiage straight from the module. Exam 1 was not terrible but certainly a degree more difficult than the quizzes. Exam 2 is upcoming.\n\nProjects \u2013 there are 5 projects along with one optional/ungraded warmup project and one extra credit project. The warmup project is not worth mentioning, should only take 30 min or less. I don't plan to do the extra credit. High-level overview of projects is projects 1, 2, and 4 have good documentation and are easy to follow. Project 3 had terrible documentation but once you figure it out it is incredibly easy. Project 5 had issues as people have discussed.\n\nProject 1 (Spanning Tree) and Project 2 (Distance Vector) deal with algorithms for bridges and routers, respectively. These were interesting projects, each took me about 10 hours but I am also slow and some people completed much faster. Student generated tests were provided to make sure the algorithms were working.\n\nProject 3 (SDN Firewall) set up a firewall to block/allow traffic. The worst part about this project was the documentation and understanding how to get started. I spent a lot of time trying to figure out what I needed to do, once I got started it took around 2-3 hours. People make it sound bad with the number of rules to write, in my opinion it goes very fast if you just implement the rules literally as they are laid out. If they say block x, then block x, if they say allow y, then allow y, don\u2019t get creative. Overall not super interesting.\n\nProject 4 (BGP Hijacking) I actually enjoyed this project quite a bit. There are some tedious aspects to it, but I found it overall interesting. A paper is provided with a network topology, you basically recreate the topology where there is a malicious actor. Took me a bit of time due to user-errors in my implementation but once I realized my mistakes it was easy to fix.\n\nProject 5 (BGP Measurements) there were some issues specific to this semester that likely won\u2019t be an issue in the future. The project was changed after it was released, we lost 2 days and they gave us 2 extra days. I feel bad for those who started early and had to restart. There was also a lot of ambiguity. This was by far the hardest project of the semester, many people put in massive hours due to new clarifications, thankfully I didn\u2019t have that issue but still put in probably 30-40 hours total. I feel compelled to say that while there were issues with this project, it wasn\u2019t the end of the world that some people made it out to be, and it was still manageable. The one thing that I didn\u2019t like about this project is there was no testing framework so it was somewhat of a blind submission and hoping it works. The project concept was to read in files and process various information, such as how many unique IP prefixes are advertised.\n\n As someone who does not have a CS background, I still say this class was incredibly easy. One difficult project and one project with poor documentation, but other than that it was smooth sailing all semester. Average on exam was I believe a high B, average on quizzes are typically in the 90ish percent range, and on the four projects that have been graded so far, at worst 75% of the class got 100%. I put the rating as neutral as the modules were dry and I was expecting a greater challenge from the projects. I\u2019ll update when the remaining grades are released.\n",

                        "body": "Having taken classes including AOS, IHPC, HPCA, DC, ESO, this class is trivial and definitely an easy A, relatively speaking.\n\nI rated the class Neutral overall because the content was only mildly interesting, but certainly not challenging or thought-provoking. Lesson modules took about an hour each week to complete. Projects were sporadic, so I spent 0 hours for most weeks, and maybe 5-6 hours in the weeks they were due, so I averaged to about an extra 2 hours/week.\n\nI agree with other commenters about project 5 (BGPM) being disorganized - the course staff could have done a lot better. But at the same time, this need not frighten you unless you have zero experience in any non-class setting, where oftentimes goals or tasks are not 100% specified for you. I also think it's important to understand the type, quality, and expectations of students who enroll in this course (and thus how they will perceive the course quality), given that it has a reputation for being one of the easiest classes in the OMS program.\n\nFor example, I found the following post (anonymous, taken verbatim from EdStem) to be representative of many students' experiences, expectations, and quality of posts on EdStem (which to be fair, means there's a significant degree of selection bias towards the students who post a lot):\n\n> Hey, all\nI should say that we are suppose to have a wonderful semester. But this last homework brings too many issues. I do not know whether it is just I that have that feeling. I did not learn what should I implement but I learned how graph, how to remove errors, how to change different timestamp based on quite inconsistent instructions, how to solve solve data structure such as dictionary in dictionary(I personally do not know why. It is insufficient. Won\u2019t be able to use in further question solving). This homework is quite break my thanksgiving. No test case! Specific input and output, which make us no zoom to walk. Guess that If you could not figure out the task1 or  you make something wrong in task1, then I think you guys know what will happen to your task1B,C. Task2,3,4. I saw that one of our folks decided to give up this hw. But it is 15 points. You have to make sure that you won\u2019t lose any point in exam1 and 2 to pass this course but get a B. I personally came here to learn what I want to learn. I did not see those debugging or understanding meaningful much to me. I was happy to be part of this course. But now I am so disappointed about this arrangement. I hope my voice could get TA or our professor attention. Before you make any decisions, here are hundreds and thousands of student will be effected. \nFor all of the students who are struggling. You are not alone. Points/grades won\u2019t be everything. It still is Three days to the deadline. I wish you all the best. Enjoy your weekend and Thanksgiving.\n\nFor background, tasks 1, 2, 3, and 4 are loosely related but not dependent on each other. There are only dependencies across parts of the same task.\n\nLike, yeah, if you don't know or want to learn how to debug, how to use nested dictionaries, or how to use basic and very standard python graphing libraries like matplotlib, then you won't like the last project. But these are so basic that I question your readiness or intentions for enrolling in OMSCS in the first place. There is no tricky programming whatsoever in this class.\n\nIf you expect to be coddled through each project, then you won't like the last project. If the idea of being told to submit a graph of your results without being told *exactly* how that graph should look frightens you, then you won't like the last project. If you don't know what a CDF is and can't learn about it from a Google search, then you won't like the last project.\n\nIf you've had any real-world experience whatsoever (where you've relied on your own good judgement to make sound decisions in situations where something isn't *perfectly* specified for you), you'll do *just fine* in the last project and in the class.",

Project in the middle were alright but time consuming (SDN takes up a lot of time and very tedious). \n\nFor this semester, last project BGP Measurements was a mess. This is probably the worst project I have ever experienced in OMSCS.  Be prepared to spend a lot of time. They changed the TAs this semester so disregard the good TA comments from past semesters.\n\nTAs very unresponsive, project documentation is lacking, oh and they revised the project several business days after releasing it --after they emphasized starting projects early. Unclear requirements met with no testing suite. Most TAs are unresponsive. The only TAs responsive is the head TA (you know who), the SDN firewall TA (bless this guy), and BGPH TA. Even the TAs for BGPM don't even know what they are doing for the requirements. The professor had to chime in the BGPM posts to help out clarify some things --that's how bad the last project is. This is probably the worst project I have ever experienced in OMSCS. \n\nAlso the lectures are bad --just slides and endless amount of dry content. They definitely changed this class for Fall 2021. Dont recommend. Only good thing is that the professor cares and tries her best when it is needed but overall dont look like the CN team dont care. Just delivery of content/project and TAs should improve.\n\n",

                        "body": "Computer networks CS6250 is my first course in OMSCS. I took it in Fall 2021, and I am finishing up my last assignment in this course, 1 quiz and 1 exam left, so I believe it is a good time to share some of my experiences.\n\nA little bit of my background, I am a software engineer with 3+ years of experience, studied Computer networks from an Electrical Engineering perspective before, but never took the CS one. Not a super expert in Python, but I definitely did not face much difficulties with a bit of help from Google.\n\nTo summarize it, I will recommend it as a first course in this program or a second class paired with a more difficult one. The course contents are decent, and the first 2 projects are good, but the last 3 projects are not that ideal.\n\nThe course content is decent, starting with somewhat a review of undergraduate level CN topics such as TCP, UDP, 7-layer model and slowly transits into routing including interdomain algorithms and BGP for interdomain routing. Some of the newer topics in CN covered at the end such as SDN, Video and CDN. Many people do not like content being delivered like a self-reading and the lecture video is actually reading the script for you, but I found it okay, asI do not watch the lecture video at all.\n\nThe projects account for 66% of the total marks and they are more like running simulations than developing actual products. The first 2 projects in my opinion are quite interesting and rewarding as they ask you to develop spanning tree and distance vector algorithms. The walk through videos for these 2 projects are also good.\n\nHowever, starting from project 3, it goes downhill. Project 3, is named as SDN firewall, but in fact you just need to read the problem description and translate that into a bunch of rules in a config file, and write a piece of very uninteresting code to parse those rules. It is more related to IT than CS in my opinion. It is very time consuming as you endup typing up 60-70 rules in a config file, and yes you may make typos and it took some time to debug. The auto testing only comes in the second week, so I manually tested it and that takes a lot of manual work. \n\nProject 4 is named as BGP hijacking, which again is not difficult but a lot of work. You are given a simple network topology in a starting code and you need to come up with a new topology according to a paper. You need to carefully assign IP addresses and draw a topology diagram properly so that you can translate the topology into a bunch of config files, yes config files again! After that you need to carefully modify the starting code to make it work with the new topology, which consists of no more than finding and replacing some strings.\n\n Project 5 BGP measurement is in fact a data processing project, where you are given some data files and you need to read the data, plot some graphs and calculate some statistics, of course all related to BPG. Some of the questions' descriptions are misleading, so that some classmates actually are wasting time figuring out something useless. This is the only time I tried to post something in ED and TAs are not responsive. I heard from a student from the previous semester that this project takes 30-40 hours to finish, but it only takes me 6 hours as they improved the project a little bit with more precise requirements. In my opinion data processing, visualization skills are very different from software engineering skills for developing apps or systems, and could involve a ton of topics that this class should not and cannot cover such as Hadoop, Spark, Mapreduce etc. Therefore, this project should really not be here.\n\nAlthough I have spent more ink describing the non-ideal part of this course, I still feel I learned something in the end, and the topics covered here may help me in the future. So I will still recommend this course but at the same time point out that the last 3 projects are probably not that rewarding.\n",

                        "body": "This course is poor in my opinion. My review is in two parts, content, followed by coursework.\n\nFirst, most of the content is poorly written, inconcise, duplicated across slides, and even conflicting across slides. Most explanations are bloated and poorly worded making them hard to follow and understand, I spent significant amounts of time just re-reading slides again and again because the grammar and wording was so poor. \n\nThe structure of the content is also all over the place, now this might just be my learning style, but I generally prefer some kind of overview, followed by a deep dive into the main concepts, maybe some caveats, followed by a wrap up. That's not what this course does. The structure is random, the slides lead you down a path, throwing vaguely worded concepts at you left and right until you're completely lost and unsure how everything fits together. Without having a structure to hang everything off, it makes it very hard to learn.\n\nThe coursework isn't much better, because they use an autograder, the submitted files have to be very exact. I understand why they use the autograder (too many to mark manually) - but as a result almost all the courseworks involve 80% of your time learning exactly how to format your answers to match the rubric, and only 20% on understanding the actual course content. The coursework descriptions have pages and pages of detail on exactly what steps need to be followed to get the result. I have become an expert at figuring out how to output the answers they need based on what the questions/rubric specify, but I don't think I've learned anything at all about networking from these courseworks. \n\nThis was my 7th course in the OMSCS, all of them vary in quality and style but they've all been good in various ways, but this one was mostly a waste of time for me. \n\n---- Update\n\nDespite not liking the course at all, I did the extra credit project and absolutely loved it. The project asked us to pick an internet \"event\" of our choice and perform some analysis on the BGP advertisements associated with it. I picked the facebook BGP outage from October and spent time investigating it and analysing the pattern of BGP announcements/withdrawals. I learned more from this extra credit project on BGP than either of the two official BGP projects. If only more projects were more open ended like this one.",

First, parse a text file and convert it to OpenFlow fields, and secondly, write and test some Firewall rules), it's not so bad. However, the error messages provided by OpenFlow suck and can be misleading, and you might take a while to figure out your bugs due to this. The BGP project is fine if you have used Python notebooks. If not, you'll have a bit of a learning curve and using the VM means your performance is going to be annoyingly slow. You might be better off installing everything natively on your computer and then just checking it on the VM once done. I was surprised at the number of people complaining about this project. It really wasn't that difficult. If they ask you to give the top 5 ASes by some metric, and you find there are 10, not 5, then fine, give them the top 10. Don't whine about unclear instructions. These people aren't going to make it in courses like ML, where everything is vague. ",

                        "body": "TL;DR: Interesting course; great TAs; don't let a non-CS background scare you off but make sure you are good with Python or willing to spend extra time learning it in more depth; as with any class, start the projects early; challenging but rewarding projects.\n\nIt's important to note that I don't have a traditional CS background, and before this class had not spent a ton of time in Python. For context, I did not major in CS or math in undergrad; I have ~7 years of IT experience in mostly technical roles; I've spent plenty of time in Node.js via a coding bootcamp. So there was a bit of a learning curve when it came to Python, which accounts for why I marked this as a hard course and accounts for extra time spent researching data structures in Python. But I'm really glad I took this course, it was super interesting (although a bit dry content at times) and provided great perspective on networking. I loved that there was an intro module or two to make sure you were up to speed with things like TCP and UDP, I knew the concepts pretty well but it was a great formal intro for someone like me who doesn't have a traditional CS background. The SDN modules and project were super interesting too. After a good grind, I was really happy to come out with an A in the course. If you don't have a traditional CS background or haven't worked with Python much, I would highly recommend brushing up there first, more than just an intro level. Get some work in with different data structures and such - dicts, sets, tuples, etc. I wouldn't let that (not having a traditional CS background) scare you off entirely if you're willing to spend a little bit of extra time focusing on Python (which I think was well worth it, and combined with an interesting course and great TAs, makes this course great). \n\nProjects:\nFor Summer 2021 we had 4 projects as mentioned in some previous reviews. \n\nSpanning Tree (P1) and Distance Vector (P2) - Easy to Medium. Great video walkthroughs for each to help you understand what you need to do.\n\nSDN Firewall (P3) - Medium. Definitely start this one early, the API used is a bit funky but the TAs did a great job providing extra documentation and explaining aspects that were used in the project. I didn't leave myself enough time on this one, managed to scramble for a decent grade but definitely start it when it comes out to make sure you understand the API. Once you do that it's really not too difficult.\n\nBGP Measurements (P4) - Hard. This one was a real grind. As other reviews said, the environment makes it tough. But the TAs were all over EdStem to clarify things. At the end of the day though, this project feels so good to get completed. After scrambling on SDN, I started this one the day it came out and I was alright. It was still a lot of work even starting the first day because it's not easy to setup and get started. But looking back on this one, it was a great grind and a great way to close out the course. \n\nTests:\nBoth tests were pretty straightforward. I spent a several hours reading through the study guide (student created, essentially just all the course modules in one place) a couple of times and going over the quizzes and made a 95 on the final. The test questions are all from the course content which is great. If you read the modules you will be good.\n\nQuizzes: \nQuizzes were not open note - at least for Summer. You'll want to make sure you actually soak in the modules before taking them and they aren't so bad. I came to appreciate the fact that quizzes they essentially forced you to study for the exams throughout the semester. The quizzes are also similar to the exams.",

The key technical skill is being able to work with sets and dictionaries in Python. The lecture material is entirely text-based, and quizzes and exams are straight out of the lecture material. Reading the source material is recommended but not required as the lectures are paraphrased from the source material. Starting with this semester, quizzes are closed-book. You're good to take the quiz after reading the lecture material. I took about 2 hours to prep for each exam. \n\nSummer semester has 4 projects: Spanning Tree Protocol, Distance Vector, SDN, and BGP Measurements. The first two projects are very well-documented. It took a bit to get my head around the SDN project, but I was able to work through it thanks to the annotated documentation provided by the instruction team. \n\nBGPM still needs significant refinement. The requirements are unclear, the API has minimal documentation, and there's no official testing provided to verify that your implementation is correct. The Jupyter notebook environment is also unstable. I spent as much time on BGPM as I spent on projects 1-3 combined. Luckily grading seems to be fairly lenient. As long as you put in a good-faith effort, you should receive high marks on this project. \n\nUltimately, this is a good summer course, and would also work well as a 2nd course during spring/fall semesters. It's also a good 1st course if you're new to the program. ",

The summer semester I took has 4 projects and they have very elaborate videos/instructions on how to approach the projects. \nOut of the 4 projects, only the final two projects need VM. \nThe final two projects(SDN/BGP Measurements) use APIs/Libraries very specific to networking, hence it may take some time to figure them out. Ensure you read the documentation and the external links provided in the documentation to make your life easier. However, the class is pretty active on slack and you will find most of the answers there.\n It seems more than 80% receive A in this class as the grading is pretty lenient too. I had some panic moments due to a lack of auto grader though. There are quizzes after each class (12 classes, 10 quizzes) and two exams(mid and final, not cumulative). \nThe workload varies. The first two projects took about 10-12 hours including reading instructions, watching videos, debugging submitting. The SDN project took about 7-8 hours. The BGP project took some time to wrap my head around it. This is not complex but there are things you have to figure out about the API/graphs/plotting etc and the time spent could be around 25-30 hours. Quizzes and exams are memory-based. You can spend about an hour on each quiz and 7-8 hours total for both exams. So about 80 hours is a realistic number of hours you will spend on this course.\nIt's a good summer class or a to pair up with another class. Good luck.",

The video quality is poor and the transcripts/readings have errors of every kind: typos, grammatical errors, terms used before they're defined, redundancy, failure to give proper context or motivation, and many more. The quizzes are similar.

                        "body": "This class was very easy and doable in the summer. There were some frustrating parts, but overall I think that the knowledge gained is very useful.\n\nPros\n\n- The class is text based and works very well with text-based flash cards such as Anki. This might be a negative for most though, depending on how you\n prefer information given to you.\n - They take a very pragmatic approach to networking that I found to be immensely helpful to me as a software engineer. \n - Projects 1-3 took less than 1 hour to complete and test. \n - Modules were fairly condensed, following a paper or the lecture book, and usually took less than an hour each week to get through. \n - Module quizzes are very similar to weekly and midterm/final exams. \n - Very easy, required less than 10 hours for each week (aside from the BGP measurements project). I received near 100s on both midterm and final and \n had a ~99 in the class going into the final. \n \n Cons\n\n - Almost no video content to speak of. This was fine for me personally, as the instructors accent is very thick. I would almost never watch the \n lectures, instead using the content transcript provided to make notes. This worked very well for me, but I could see many students taking issue with \n this. \n - Project 3 was incredibly boring and tedious, requiring you to build 50 firewall rules.  \n - Project 4 (BGP Measurements) was a nightmare because of its ambiguity. Many questions were asked, and few received responses. The problem was that \n students started duplicating questions and the instructors quickly became overwhelmed. By the end of the project there were hundreds of missing \n responses. \n - Start BGP measurements early. I am highly proficient in Python and this one took the entire week for me to complete. Of course, the ambiguity of the questions were such that I had to do several times the work since I wasn't sure what they wanted. \n- No automatic grader for submitted code, but testing harness provided by TAs is still very good. \n   \nSteps to succeed\n\n- Use the study guide provided to make an Anki deck for each module. The study guide questions are almost always answered in lecture content and are \ndefinitely used to guide exam questions. For the quizzes and tests, you should know these questions very well.\n- The extra credit is worth a whopping 3% of your grade. If you find yourself in a precarious situation, be sure to do it. Once I figured out how to \nget the data they wanted, it was a breeze. Total time for the EC was 3-5 hours. Also, they do not say you cannot use examples provided in the lecture,\n so do yourself a favor a stick to one of those. \n- Each project has a testing harness the TAs will share with you. Make sure you fully test your code out with the variety of testing sources provided \nby the instructors. \n- Be wary of the BGP measurements project. This will be challenging as the questions are highly ambiguous and it requires a great deal of \nsomewhat complicated Python code. This one took me a great deal of time and I am highly proficient in Python.\n- If you find yourself confused by the lecture content, the book is available as a PDF online. I found it useful to skim through sections that were \nbeing taught for additional information where necessary. \n- Office hours are not useful. \n- The TAs are in the slack channel, be sure to join, but be careful of what you share.

But it didn't feel like much painful, giving it a \"medium\" difficulty though. Only the second last week was much condensed because the last lesson's quiz (most lengthy among others), and project (most complex than others) and extra credit (most unusual than the entire course) were due altogether. Otherwise, it was nicely paced.\n\nTAs and Professor are fine and helpful.\n\nThe course had 10 Quizzes corresponding to 10 Lessons (10%), and 2 Exams, 12% each. Both are fine as long as you follow along with lessons. Had an extra credit task (3%). Most importantly had 5 projects (66%):\n    1. Simulating Networks using Mininet (optional) [Least time consuming 5 Hrs]\n    2. Spanning Tree Protocal (18%)\n    3. Distance Vector Routing (18%)\n    4. Software Defined Networking (12%)\n    5. BGP measurement (18%) [Most time consuming 25hrs]\n\nI bought 6th edition of Kuross and Ross book \"Computer Networks\". In lessons, the 6th edition is referenced mostly. And on some placed the 7th edition is referenced especially in the topics of \"Software Defined Networking\" and \"Applications\". I referenced the book for the first half of the course and it was helpful.\n\nI also tried to get familiar with Mininet before the start of the course. Doesn't really need it. You can pick it up in the course, not heavily get used.\n\nVideos are not much helpful. The written content in lessons is sufficient.\n\nOverall, a nice course. I liked it. Might be possible to double up in spring/fall terms. But make sure to start on the projects and Extra credit task ASAP (especially the last one BGPm).",

The assignments aren't hard, assuming you know some Python, but studying for the quizzes and exams will be a bit rough (as in mentally) because, if you have no interest in the subject matter, it will just be pure memorization followed by instantly forgetting the material. But again, this is a good one if you need to focus on work for a while or just need to (mostly) tune out for a semester, but still want to make progress toward graduating. From what I gathered, those who enjoy this subject found the course to be really good, it just wasn't for me. That said, it's very well run and organized, which makes it a smooth ride even if you're someone that will probably never think about networking again. Bottom line, it's a great course - but if networking isn't your thing, don't expect to be too excited by the material.",

                        "body": "This was a great compliment to my undergrad networks course, as it covered more practical, real-world issues in networking, whereas my undergrad course had a more academic tone. I particularly liked coverage of security issues, defense tactics, and software-defined networking.\n\n### Pros\n\n1. A good summer course.  It's not difficult but still provides a wealth of knowledge while requiring steady attention.\n2. Lectures - some complain about them, but I think they set a nice standard, b/c they're text-based. I think you'll find they save a lot of time on note-taking. In part b/c they're already a great starting point (just copy them into a document and revise as needed), and b/c they lack small inconveniences of video lectures - accents or bad handwriting, slow videos, continually pausing or skipping back to capture correct wording, taking screenshots, etc. \n3. This course flows cohesively. Meaning, lecture material directly carries over into quizzes, assignments, and exams; there aren't many surprises or tangents. A less cohesive course might be one like KBAI (before its recent revisions), where the Raven's course project had little to do with lectures and maybe left classmates feeling ill prepared for it; it felt like a separation from the rest of the course. This course doesn't have that - everything stays bound to lecture material throughout the course, which also means lectures do a great job of setting you up for success.\n4. Course projects are mostly well done. The first 2 provide exemplary handoff and run-through videos. The 3rd project (SDN) is a bit more cumbersome, but the 4th one (BGP Measurements), wasn't so good. I mention its issues below.\n\n### Cons\n\nThe last project had 2 glaring quality issues:\n1. its requirements were poorly worded and questionable in some places. They rightfully frustrated or concerned a number of students. It's as if the assignment wasn't worked through or reviewed by instructional peers prior to releasing to hundreds of students. By comparison, the TA that administered the first 2 projects exercised more care over the requirements and hand-off process to students. Prior semester students voiced similar complaints about this project, so it's unfortunate if the assignment isn't being improved from one semester to the next.\n2. The Jupyter Notebook environment was a cumbersome distraction (and requirement); it should be dropped. Instructors should find a way to administer this assignment w/out requiring it be a Jupyter Notebook.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nI found this course rewarding, and generally a pleasant educational experience. The text-based lectures are convenient and easy to consume, and the course stays true to material presented in them.\n\nThis course's primary quality issue is the final project. Making its requirements more explicit, w/example data to better depict what a task is asking for or how to handle edge cases, would would make the course so much better.",

If you want to brush up on networking or are just looking for a down semester, I'd recommend it.\n\nThe weekly lectures were fine, if not a little dry, but that's not unexpected. There are weekly closed book quizzes to go along with the lectures that I was not a big fan of. The questions often seemed difficult to answer by just using what was presented in the lectures, pulling from the 'optional' textbook which I did not opt to purchase, and sometimes just contradicting what was said in lectures. I usually got somewhere between a 70-90% (the quizzes are 10% of overall grade so each one isn't too important, but overall they add up).\n\nThe exams were also fine, exam 2 is upcoming, but exam 1 seemed more fair to me than the quizzes. Exams are worth 12% each.\n\nThe projects were the best part overall, worth 66% total. The first 3 projects I found interesting and helpful towards understanding the course content, each one took me about 4 hours. Don't underestimate them though, I did get cocky on project 2 and didn't bother running the student test suites, which cost me a big chunk of the grade. The 4th I won't harp on as its already been done. I did find it interesting, but I can't argue that it needs some polishing. It took me probably 10-15 hours total, most of which I did not enjoy. I think there are also 2 other projects in fall/spring.\n\nThere is also an extra credit project worth 3% of the overall grade, can't speak to it as I didn't bother with it.",

                        "body": "#### Lectures and quizzes (10%)\n12 chapters in total, each with a follow-up quiz, quizzes are close-book using proctortrack with around 15 questions each, most of them are single-choice questions. Room scan not required. For some part of the lectures there are no videos and only transcripts are provided. I don't find the lectures hard to follow in general, but for the first few weeks I recommend reading the K&R text book to bring yourself up to speed.\n\n#### Projects (66%)\nIn summer semester there are 4 projects in total: spanning tree, distance vector, SDN firewall and BGP measurements, plus one warmup (no credit) and one extra credit (3% of total). All of them uses python. No gradescope for this class, so you have to implement your own tests to assure the robustness of the code before TAs grade it, luckily there are student-provided test scripts for the first 3 projects. None of the first 3 projects took me more than a day thanks to those tests.\n\nHowever this is not the case for the final project, which is basically a data analytics assignment to process bgpstream caches and plot graphs on jupyter notebook. There isn't much coding involved but I consider this project to be time consuming due to following reasons:\n\n1. Instructions are too short and poorly worded, starting from part3 you need to either look up the detailed explanations on explicit RTBH events posted on Ed or attend office hours to figure out what exactly are they asking you to do.\n\n2. Class-provided virtual environment is needed, depending on the hardware and efficiency of your implementation, the notebook kernel might crash while running, at least it happened to me several times, and was a gigantic waste of time. Allocate more resources to the VM might help, but I ended up installing all dependencies and run the program on the host machine.\n\n#### Exams (24%)\nOne mid-term and one final exam, close-book using proctortrack and requires room scan. The questions are not too different from the quizzes, and you have sufficient time to finish them. \n#### Conclusion\nWriting this review after the final project. I don't have previous CS background and consider this course to be beginner friendly, would rate it very easy without the final project, hopefully they can rewrite the instructions for the final project and make some of them less ambiguous. Recommend it as a first class (if you don't get into 6300 or 7646) or a summer class to pair with another.",

                        "body": "I come from a non-CS (B.S. Biology), non-SWE background and found this course to be relatively useful. The content itself was not super captivating, but it helped to form a foundation and understanding of just how the internet works. Overall, great intro course to how networks work in general, and it's a good jumping off point to dive into topics more deeply on my own.\n\nFor the summer term, there were 4 projects (66% total worth), 10 quizzes (10% total worth, average 1 quiz a week), 2 exams (each worth 12%), and 1 extra credit assignment worth 3%.\n\nThere were a lot of complaints for the last two projects this term due to poor documentation, language in the learning modules that can be polished up, overall workload required, and time-constraints. That said, I found the projects relatively straightforward even from a non-CS background who doesn't even work in the software industry. Across the board at GA Tech, you're expected to already know how to program and if not, be able to pick up a given language to complete the assignment. Many of the negative reviews and experiences stemmed from students unable to figure out how to troubleshoot, understand data structures, or dig deeper. There are some grammatical errors in the Canvas modules, sure. But the references to each of the publications are listed right at the bottom of the page. It doesn't hurt to click on a link and read a second source if you're confused. It's possible to score highly on all quizzes just by going off the info on the modules and not having to read elsewhere. They are sufficient to understand the concept. Refer to the publications if you want to dig deeper and solidify your understanding.\n\nThe first two assignments, Spanning Tree and Distance Vector, were very straightforward and easy enough to figure out with all the resources available and test suites posted by students and TAs. I spent roughly 10 hours on each in total. The second to last, SDN Firewall, took a bit more thought up front, but once you figure it out, it's relatively straightforward to implement and test. The last project took the most time due to the number of questions to address and amount of programming involved. I spent closer to 20 hours for this one just to get my answers right and feel confident in my work. Again, doable if you dig deep in the documentation, search EdStem, and know how to troubleshoot. Dictionaries and sets are your friends, print() statements for debugging, and help() function are what I used to understand more of the underlying object structure.\n\nDon't listen to all the negative reviews here. This is a masters program, so some effort will be required. If you get stuck or complain because you don't have a nice 50 minute YouTube video to walk you through the assignment, the pseudo-algorithm to implement, and 10 different case examples and test suites, then you'll have a bad time... Also, if you procrastinate on the assignments, then that's on you.",

For that alone it made the course difficult. If you are new to python and don't know your way around OOP and the basic data structures python offers (especially dictionaries), I would not recommend this course. \n\nQuizzes - Quizzes suck, they require explicit memorization of course content (which is usually expected to some degree), but also require you to infer some tricky/ambiguous language.  \n\nExams - Still haven't taken the final yet, but the first exam was \"OK\", nothing brutal but my only gripe is that if you didn't understand a concept, you may miss several questions as they typically built upon each other. I would recommend that they make each question a completely independent concept from one another if possible. \n\nWhat I mean by that is they would ask a question like: (1). If A, then B and another just opposite logic: (2) If B, then A. \n\nif you got them wrong, then you missed two questions for not understanding/memorizing one concept. \n\n\nOverall - I would take again, it wasn't insanely difficult, easy B and semi-difficult A, but then again I knew python prior to taking this course.... \nAlso buckle up for the BGP Measurements project its LONG and the requirements as laid out in the project handout .pdf are completely ambiguous. I think the whole teaching staff completely dropped the ball on the BGP Measurements project, it needs to be refined so that any ambiguity is removed. \n\n\n\n\n\n",

                        "body": "I do not usually write a review but I just have to leave one for this class, for the sake of the future generation who wants to take this class. So here goes my first review ever on OMSCentral. \n\nLet's start from the positive thing first. The only thing I like from this class is probably the TAs. They are mostly there on EdStem and they are responsive as well. They recorded very helpful videos on YouTube that helped us to understand the assignments better. However, the cons do outweigh the pros in this class. \n\nFirst of all, the module contents are poorly written. I'm not even an English major (nor minor), but for Pete's sake someone needs to re-read and edit the modules so students can easily understand the materials. The punctuation, the precise grammar, and just the basic things you'd need to understand the materials are simply non-existent. You'd probably fare better reading Kurose book on your own and/or google the topics yourself to better understand the subjects (and when you do that, it makes you wonder why you'd even pay for this class in the first place).  \n\nSecondly, assignments are probably (or should I say most definitely) not for a Python newbie, so you may want to brush that skill very well before joining the class. And when I say very well, I mean very, very well, otherwise you'll end up spending all weeknights and weekends cranking out your code for the assignments. There is no Gradescope nor any autograder, so nobody checks your code before you submit it. You can only check it with test cases/topologies. Also, the assignment is due every two weeks. \n\nIn addition to the biweekly assignment frenzy, there are also weekly quizzes. Logically speaking, it is called weekly quiz because there supposed to be just 1 quiz per week, however, on the July 4th long-weekend they just had to make us do not 1, but 2 weekly quizzes in one week. Yes, you read that right. I had to cancel my long weekend plan the minute I noticed this. And as a cherry on top, everything (quizzes, exams) is closed-book and almost 100% rote. It really is just too much for a short summer class. \n\nTL;DR - if you're a Python wizard and have a photographic memory, then this class might be for you, otherwise, take it from me and do yourself a favor: skip this one and find another class worthy of your precious time (and your hard-earned money).

                        "body": "Overall, a good survey course on networking that goes a bit deeper than a typical undergrad networking course. You will work on interesting projects that are not very difficult, but still manage to enforce some of the concepts that are touched on in the class. The course organization is top notch. Grades were typically back to students within a week, which is impressive considering how many students are enrolled at a given time. \n\nThe course lectures are mostly text based, with some video lessons sprinkled throughout. The videos consist mostly of reading the text that is currently on the page, so you can mostly skip watching them. Some of the earlier videos that walk through spanning tree protocol or distance vector may be helpful for your projects, but I stopped watching them after the midterm entirely. There is interesting content in the lectures, although the delivery is not the best. \n\nThe weekly quizzes will keep you on track as far as reading is concerned. They are open notes, open internet, and most questions are straight out of the reading. There will be a couple each week that require a little more thought.\n\nOne of the best parts of the class were the projects. Although they are on the easier side of projects in OMSCS, they still do a great job of testing your understanding of networking algorithms. The second (Spanning Tree) and third (Distance Vector) are probably the most difficult, but some test cases are provided so you can perform a sanity check. In the semester I was enrolled, students worked together to build test suites that did a good job of validating your implementation. Hopefully the TAs held on to those projects and will distribute to later semesters. The last project (BGP Metrics) was the only one that was not much fun. It was the first semester that it was released and will likely go through some iterations.\n\nExams are straightforward. The TAs provide a study guide that you can work through in order to prepare. I recommend answering the questions on the study guide and running through it before you take the exam.\n\nThe teaching staff is very involved and does quite a lot to make sure that students can be successful in the course. Piazza posts would typically have an instructor answer within an hour, and usually less time than that. \n\nThis class is a great candidate for a summer course, or to pair with another course. ",

I went in primarily to complete the foundational requirements thinking that this would be an easy class but the learning that I was able to get and the gaps in my understanding I was able to fill was so much that I am more confident on networking basics now. From what I understand this class covers the next level of Networking taught at undergrad levels. I never took any undergrad networking course so wasn't sure if I would be able to comprehend the content but the topics covered are not difficult even if you don't have an undergrad exposure to networking. \n\n## Pros: \n1. The weekly tests(open book) make you go through the content every week even if its just .7% percent of the total grade it makes you learn the content at a week level which makes it easy for the mid and final exams\n2. The TAs make the learning so much more easy. They have TA chat sessions pretty much 4 days any given week. The timing is spread out and its not all in 7 pm EST but TA chats are useful. \n3. The Youtube videos that Head TAs put out at the beginning of the project makes the whole project solving experience so much easier. All projects use Python. Added to that the Slack chats are also very helpful. James Lohse the Head TA was so prompt and had a quick turnaround that getting info on projects was never a problem.\n4. The topics are well formed. I totally loved the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) and Software Defined Networking (SDN) chapters as this is practical , usable knowledge. Some of the concepts I learnt in this course helped me to connect the dots in my day job.\n5. They give out an exam guide with summarized questions which are useful in gauging exam preparedness. Exams are not difficult and will mostly mimic the weekly quizzes.\n6. The papers that are linked with course modules are also super informative. One of them is on how Youtube does its content distribution \n\n## Cons: \n1. Some of the module content reading can get boring. I had to supplement reading modules with watching some youtube videos/Lynda.com videos to get a better understanding of topics.\n2. Some projects can take inordinate amount of time to solve. I remember working on the SDN project for close to 2 weeks which is the total duration given for project submission. The project was not even that complex but required reading through API documents and some of the project description wording was unclear, the TA chats were super helpful but for what the final version ended out to the amount of time it took was just inordinate. \n\nThis course was more like an EDX.com style course as in the most content is in the reading modules than in the videos. If you are someone who is from non CS background then you need to enroll in this course. If not for the 10 courses for graduation then maybe as an extra 11th course.",

I had little to no Computer Networks background, I work as a Software Developer (C/C++), but my undergrad was a BA in Information Science. I have little experience in advanced Algorithms and this got me on the second project. Even having absolutely bombed the second project, better managing my time and giving myself more room to actually work through the projects early gave me success in the class. \n\nSimulating Networks - Insanely easy. \nSpanning Tree Protocol - Tests your algorithms, make sure you apply yourself and follow the walkthrough. You should be able to figure it out if you start early !\nDistance Vector - Follows in difficulty from project 2, slightly easier since it's a similar concept. Tests your algorithms, follow the walkthrough.\nSDN Firewall - Easy, spend a lot of time with the documentation  before starting and the implementation is a piece of cake.\nBGP Hijacking - Easy, fun but not in a challenging/rewarding way.\nBGP Measurements - Caught me off guard, difficult given the environment it's in, the first semester for this project so hopefully improvements will be made. Challenging in a rewarding way, requires a lot of thought. \n\nThe extra credit was a simpler version of BGP Measurements, it was a lot of fun to work with the same environment/setup after getting to know it a little bit and was more rewarding because I already had a clue of the direction to go in. But it won't make a huge difference in your grade and it's probably time better spent focusing on the exam. \n\nI'd say the course is an awesome first class and I learned so much, great for learning python (I had not touched it before), and good exposure to various concepts. Professor Konte is also a great resource and provides a lot of great information alongside awesome TAs.",

Took this course to learn about networking in general, and because it was rated as an easy class and I wanted to chill.\n\nIt was as easy as I expected it to be. If you know how to code and read, you'll be fine.\n\nClass is broken up into 7 projects that total 70% of your grade, two honorlock-proctored exams at 10% of your grade each that cover the first and second half of the course content (aka, not cummulative), and a bunch of open book quizzes that total 10% of your grade. \n\nThe projects can be really easy sometimes, and other times take a bit more thought, but are otherwise not very difficult. They do actually teach you something about networking algorithms and concepts to some extent, which is good. Allocating a day right before the project is due is generally sufficient. I received 100% on every project, so I think that is a pretty reasonable assumption. Projects are done in Python, generally on the course-provided VM. \n\nI studied for about 2 hours for the second exam, received an 80%, and about 5 hrs for the first exam, and received an 90%. Quizzes can be sort of easy sometimes (search and find solution), while other times require some thought, but still are centered around just making sure you did the reading - there is a quiz for every week there is a reading. \n\nReadings are not bad, and teach you a good amount about the networking topic at hand. I personally find networking a bit dry and boring, but also very useful and applicable in the real world. So, even though I didn't read too much in depth, just enough to complete quizzes and exams, I still feel I got a better understanding of networking from it.\n\nInstructor is VERY active on Piazza - really nice! TAs are helpful on Piazza as well.\n\nI was attempted to rate it a neutral, however, because, to be frank, this course is not graduate-level intensity. But, overall, I Liked the class because it did exactly what I expected it to do - help me learn some networking that I didn't know about before without being ridiculously hard.",

Overall they were great and I thought this was a good class. The projects are pretty easy. The material could still use a little more proofreading (I believe it's still in development) but I found the subject matter to be very interesting.\n\nA lot of people said the first 2 projects were harder but I finished both very quickly. I'd suggest the most straight-forward approach for the earlier projects. The TAs made video walkthroughs and I just followed those and basically completed the project by the time I finished the video.\nOddly, I found the later projects to be harder, while the general consensus was that they were easier. So maybe I'm just a bit of an oddball.\nThe projects make up most of your grade, so be sure to put the most effort into them. I thought they were pretty fun, but I generally enjoy programming. \n\nThe quizzes are hard to get a 100 on consistently, but they don't count for much, so as long as you get a 70+ on them, you will still be able to get an A very easily. (They were open book the semester I took this class, apparently they're closed book now)\n\nThe exams are not too hard either, as long as you review the lecture material, you will be fine. It's really not that much material and the exams aren't cumulative, so you can cram if you really need to (although I would never recommended procrastinating anything in omscs).\n\nIt would be awesome if this class had an autograder, but the TAs have said that's unlikely due to technical short comings with Gradescope (root issues). If they could make that available, this class would be perfect: you get to learn a lot (of interesting stuff imo) and also get an easy A. Even without an autograder, I think this is a pretty good class. Over 70% of the class got As, so the course could probably be a little harder, but as long as everyone's learning, I don't really see the problem.",

                        "body": "My CS background is a couple of years of iOS development in Swift. Prior to taking this course, I had no knowledge of computer networks at all except that my proxy at work was difficult to figure out. I also had a bit of experience with Python, but not much at all (I probably couldn\u2019t write hello world without looking up the syntax).\n\nThe course content overall was great. I learned a ton about the OSI model and terms of the field like TCP and UDP. Enough to be dangerous. I mostly followed along with the recommended textbook, which has similar content to the course lectures, but adds more information and has some additional practical problems. \n\nThe course quizzes are relatively easy, but sometimes have tricky wording. I wouldn\u2019t worry so much about the quizzes since they are a small portion of the grade. \n\nThe projects were interesting, and definitely forced me to look up a lot about Python and how different data structures are implemented. It\u2019s nothing out of the ordinary though, so if you have any experience with other programming languages, it should be OK. The projects were focused mainly on different kinds of routing algorithms. \n\nOverall I did learn a lot. I would recommend doing the extra problems in the textbook as well, as this can help solidify your knowledge. Personally, I would have also liked some more practical problems as part of the class content, like using Wireshark to sniff packets, writing our own protocols, etc. This kind of practical knowledge is what I think will be more helpful in my career. That being said, I have a good foundation now to go back and do further review on these concepts and put some more time into it.",

Each week they introduced something new, and the open book quiz at the end of each chapter helps you gauge your understanding.\n\n- The projects were well organized and engaging, and at the end of the project, it all made sense!\n\n- Prof. Konte is excellent, her exam preparation office hours were beneficial, and she is active on the piazza.\n\n- TA's for this class are pretty good. (the project introduction videos cover every minor detail, and the office hours are good to get any clarification)\n\n- My classmates who came up with the test suites, you guys are amazing! Also, people who clarified questions and also answer fellow student's queries, Thank you!\n\nI got 70/70 in projects, 9/10 in the weekly class quiz, 7/10, and 9/10 in the exam.\n\nHours Put (approximate):\n\n- each week, 2 -- 4\u00a0 hours to read through the course material, make notes, and attempt the quiz.\n\n- project hours were variable, but overall 5 -- 10 hours depending on the project.\n\n- exam preparation was to review my notes and attend Prof. Konte's exam preparation office hour!\n\nI feel I got a lot more from this class than the other challenging class I took this spring, considering I am getting the same grades in both classes, 95%!"

I had someone else read the lectures to me so the grammar would pass through another person's brain and I could focus on the content rather than parsing the sentence. This was the biggest chore and made the class much more difficult than it needed to be.\n\nThe quizzes, though open notes, were also difficult because of the confusing wording of some questions. The TA team and Prof Konte were very lenient with giving back credit and the quizzes didn't heavily influence the final grade. The exams were much easier than the quizzes as the questions were more general and hit on the main points of each lecture series. Prof Konte's office hours before each exam were incredibly helpful when refreshing. I hope she continues this in the future!\n\nAside from the lectures, the projects were quick little things. The provided documentation and video walkthroughs basically handed you the solution. I could solve all of them in a few days and they required very few lines of code. I recorded the days spent on each project so you can view my work schedule. I did not record the hours spent, and some projects I did not begin right when released. There were sometimes errors in the code base since the TAs were updating to python3 and it was worth it to wait a few days for the working code. After having to update the first three projects, I purposely waited a few days to begin projects 4-6.\n\nProject 1: Simulating Networks\nReleased 1/14\nCompleted 1/16\n\nProject 2: Spanning Tree Protocol\nReleased 1/14\nCompleted 1/17\n\nProject 3: Distance Vector\nReleased 2/5\nCompleted 2/9\n\nProject 4: SDN Firewall\nReleased 2/27\nCompleted 3/9\n\nProject 5: BGP Hijacking\nReleased 3/14\nCompleted 3/18\n\nProject 6: BGP Measurements\nReleased 3/28\nCompleted 4/5\n\nThere was also an extra credit project that I did not do.\n\nOverall, the course was incredibly manageable and did not require a lot of effort. It was also not very deep. If you're looking for a little networking snack, this class will work for you. If you want to really get into networking, take something else. If the lectures were not so terrible, I might recommend this class. The projects were quite enjoyable.",

I enjoyed learning how things got to the way it was. \n\nThe only thing I didn't like was some projects didn't have tests especially the SDN project. Students needed to create tests and share their tests to fully understand what the assignment was asking for. We should not have to do that.\n\nI tend to put less effort on assignments that have unclear instructions and do not provide test cases as I feel like they were designed to waste my time. For example, SDN project requires manual testing for over 50 - 100 different situations that had vague instructions where you have to search the internet for all the possibilities of what multiple software components can do. Manual testing as in you have to spin up 4 terminals for each situation and activate the specific scenario and input the test command in the terminal. Can you imagine how long this will take? Does this really measure your knowledge of the material or is it grading how much time you have or how well you can write tests? \n\nThis reminds me of a quiz I had (not in Georgia Tech) where the professor asked the students to review the entire documentation of MongoDB within 5 days and tested us on which functions are available in MongoDB and what were the parameters and output. Sorry for the rant, I really disliked the SDN assignment. Anyway, just focus on doing well in assignments that are well organized. ",

Each project took about 2-5 hours each, with the last one taking me about 10 total. Three of the projects even had a video walkthrough.\n\nThe quizzes are dead easy as they are open world, 10-15 questions each, with an hour to complete (they take about 5-10 minutes).\n\nTests are quite easy as well. I studied 30 minutes for the final and got an 84 on it, for a 97+ grade in the class, with no extra credit (there is a 3% extra credit opportunity).\n\nThe TAs are amazingly helpful, though the head TA, James, will not be TA'ing the class any more after this semester, which is a big loss. The professor is present and answers questions on piazza, which is difficult to do given the plethora of questions asked by a class of 600+ students.\n\nThe topics in the class are broad enough to give a good overview of graduate level networking topics, with enough depth here and there to make it worth your while. In short, take the class if you need an easy ride while still learning a good bit.",

I never took a networks course in undergrad so the content here was entirely new but I can undoubtedly say I learned a lot and have gained more interest in related topics. I paired this with 6340 which was heavier, so it balanced out well.\n\nProjects: There were 6 projects over the duration of the course, each one given 2 weeks to complete.  Personally, 2 weeks was plenty of time to complete the projects. The TA\u2019s were active on Slack/Piazza and the office hours were always more helpful than not. HUGE thank you to the TA\u2019s for this, they made the course more enjoyable and less stressful. \n\nFor projects 1-5 I spent maybe 5-7 hours on each one. Project 6 was the most time consuming and took me about 15 hours to complete. Projects 2 and 3 were more algorithm focused (which I preferred as I\u2019m more comfortable with algorithms than networks in general) and the rest were more network simulation focused. \n\nQuizzes: Open note and fair, used these to study for the exams.\n\nLectures: Decent content but not really engaging. It would be nice to have more examples in the videos rather than just static diagrams with a voiceover. Other than this though, the information was helpful and thorough.\n\nExams: Fair exams, multiple choice questions but closed note. Spent a few hours going over the study guide and quizzes.\n",

The only exception was the last project, due to the fact that it was launched in this semester and it was unripe.\n\n**Quiz:**\nThe quiz answers are derived from the lectures. If you search the questions in the modules you will have no problem.\n\n**Modules:**\nModules are not so interesting but the concepts are easily digestible.\n\n**Exams:**\nIn the first exam, I followed the study guide and spent more than 20 hours in studying and I scored almost prefect. In the second exam, I just reviewed the quiz answers and spent less than 2 hours in studying, as I needed only 10% for A, and scored ~80%.\n\n**Summary:**\nEasy Course, Interesting Projects, \"Boring\" Modules",

                        "body": "__My Background__: I have a bachelor's in Computer Science. I'm interested in topics like Operating Systems, Human-Computer Interaction, and High-Performance Computing.\n\nReading the previous reviews, I was given the impression that this course would be easy, similar to Software Architecture and Design, and guess what?\n\n__Course Summary__: This was one of the most straightforward courses I've taken so far. Computer Networking introduces you to topics that focus on the Network Layer and up. It is assumed that you already know about protocols such as TCP and UDP since their introductions were very brief. Otherwise, the focus lies on how these protocols have evolved into making the network more efficient, ranging from looking at the Border Gateway Protocol to software-defined networks.\n\nIf you find that you learn better from reading, you'll get that from the lectures, as they are *predominantly text*. Also, suppose you found that courses like Graduate Introduction to Operating Systems worked too much with analogies and metaphors. In that case, these lectures will serve you well, as topics are presented in their raw state, technical jargon and all.\n\n__The Quizzes__: For each lecture, there is an accompanying quiz that must be done by the end of the week. These are open note/lectures, and worth roughly 10% of the grade total. Thus, no stress whatsoever.\n\n__The Projects__: There are five projects in this course. Each of them requires that you have basic knowledge of Python 3. All but the last project have informational slides, a detailed PDF walking through what's expected, and an hour-long video summarizing the PDF with some examples. Despite being 70% of the grade, it was not stressful given all of the resources.\n\nIt's recommended that you know about data structures up to something like Hash Tables.\n\n__The Exams__: There was a midterm and a final. The final is not cumulative, only dealing with the last six topics of the course. If you review the quiz answers, you'll do well enough. Total, both exams add up to 20% of the grade.\n\n__Overall__: 2/5. It seems the emphasis in this course was on the projects over general understanding from the lectures. This caters well to those who have the hands-on learning style, but given how easy the projects are, I'm not sure you'll learn much other than which resources to read to get to the solution. \n\n__Recommendations for the Teaching Staff__:\n- Turn the text lectures into videos, with analogies to better relate with the technical jargon. If there's interest in the subject of Computer Networks, this is the best way to show it, rather than just telling us. For example, how about describing how these protocols scale to the bigger picture of SDNs eventually by connecting these topics with the story of how a restaurant became a chain?\n- Given that [there's now a preferred qualifications section for incoming students](https://omscs.gatech.edu/preparing-yourself-omscs), the resources for each project should be significantly reduced. What do you think about only providing the PDF? If the videos are still preferred, how about shrinking it from an hour to about 30 minutes tops, only going over the problem domain with some basic examples?\n- Add weekly surveys for students to give feedback on the course quality as a whole. For instance, ask whether the quizzes have helped in learning the material on some scale. Even better, how about having feedback for the weekly lecture, letting students list the pros and cons of how the material is presented, and what they would do to improve it?",

Some people call it beginner's Python, and that may be, but if you don't actually know Python well, forget it.  I was told there was an even harder *new 'sort of a data science project' in the end.  No, thanks.  Seems very interesting and all, but the CN course kicked me square in the junk.  Sounds like it got even harder.  That was my fourth course, after taking CS6035/IIS, PUBP6725/Policies, and CS6238/SCS.  Those were not easy for me, either, but this one was harder.  I need to learn how to program.  I've taken a *lot of programming courses, and I still don't really know how to program.  If you're like me, I wouldn't take this one.

                        "body": "This was my fourth course in the OMSCS program.  My profession is in software development, and when asked, I will truthfully admit I hate dealing with networking.  While this class didn't make me fall in love with networking, it definitely taught me new things, refreshed my undergraduate knowledge, and was overall an enjoyable course.  Within the class is a mixture of projects and exams, with opportunities for extra credit.  The class is completely led by TA's.  Other than the lectures and one comment in Piazza, I never saw or heard from the Dr. Konte.  Some of the projects were challenging and confusing, but all were worthwhile.  The material for the exams comes directly from the lectures and a few readings we were given.\n\n### Coursework\n\n- **Project 1 (5%)**: This requires modifying files to simulate a network, mainly the connection type and speed between nodes.\n- **Project 2 (15%)**: This required implementing a spanning tree protocol for nodes in a given network.\n- **Project 3 (5%)**: This project focused on TCP Fast Open.  It required running tests, analyzing the results, and submitting a paper on the findings.\n- **Project 4 (15%)**: This project was very similar to Project 2; however, it focused on implementing the Bellman-Ford algorithm in regards to Distance Vector Routing.\n- **Project 5 (5%)**: This project focused on TCP Reno, TCP CUBIC, resource contention, and traffic control to prevent buffer bloat.  It required running some tests, and submitting both tests results and a paper answering some questions.\n- **Project 6 (10%)**: This project focused on implementing a Software Defined Networking Firewall (SDN Firewall).  It requires modifying files and creating a policy file to be used to test ports and routes.\n- **Project 7 (15%)**: This project focused on BGP Hijacking Attacks.\n- **Exam 1 (10%)**: This exam covered lessons 1-4.\n- **Exam 2 (10%)**: This exam covered lessons 5-8.\n- **Exam 3 (10%)**: This exam covered lessons 9-12.\n- **Piazza Extra Credit** (1%): This consisted of making a well-formed reply to 3 different discussion posts.  As long as you put forth some effort (don't reply with I agree or something similar) on all 3 posts, it was an easy 1 point added to your grade.\n- **Project 7 Extra Credit** (5%): This opportunity allows you to expand on Project 7.  It involved designing and implementing a countermeasure to the BGP hijacking attack.\n- **New Virtual Machine Extra Credit** (1%): This may not exist in all classes.  We were given an option to test a couple assignments against newly created VMs.  The class mainly used VirtualBox, but this allowed us to test VMWare and Hyper-V VMs.  The deliverable for this EC was just completing a survey on our findings with the VM of our choice.\n\n### Take-Aways\n\n- **Miscellaneous Stuff**: Do the projects.  Most of them are easy, fun, quick to complete, and straight-forward.  They may not take long, but it gives you more time at the end of the week to relax or fix any mistakes.  Read the lectures to better understand the material so you can apply that knowledge when answering test questions.\n- **Textbook**: There is no textbook for this course.  The syllabus has an optional reference book listed (Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach by Kurose & Ross, 978-0132856201).  I didn't use the book, but at the same time, a used copy off Amazon wasn't very expensive.\n- **Projects**: The projects are fairly easy and straight-forward.  They are a big portion of the grade for the course, and from my experience, doing well on the projects can definitely bring up your grade in the course (especially if you do not do well on the exams).\n- **Exams**:  The exams are challenging.  They involve a lot of application of knowledge.  The material is pulled from the lectures and projects.  Overall, I think the questions were fair, but also difficult at times.  Dr. Konte and the TAs are open to discussion on grading questions.  On one exam, ambiguities in some questions got me 10 points back.\n- **Professor and TAs**: To the best of my recollection, Dr. Konte never made an appearance in the course, and was driven completely by the TAs, who done an excellent job by the way.  There were a couple of TAs that never appeared in Piazza or Office Hours, but I feel this happens in every class.  I was afraid I was going to struggle quite a bit due to my dislike and unfamiliarity with networking, but the material was somewhat interesting and educational.\n- **Overall Grade**: I feel like I put an acceptable amount of time in this course for being deficient in networking.  The workload allowed me to have a personal life, which is great in this program.  I received 100s on all the projects.  My exam grades were 70.45, 78.68, and 80, proving the exams requires some thought, studying, and application of knowledge.  In the end, the extra credit help me finish with a 94.91 (A).\n\n# TLDR\n\nIn short, I feel this class is doable for those with limited networking skills, but may also be interesting for those who do have experience (maybe better for a condensed summer course).  Most of the extra credit opportunities are easy.  The projects are fairly easy and straight-forward.  The exams can be challenging, being based mostly on the lectures and a little from the projects.  Dr. Konte isn't around, but the TAs are great.",

There was no official way to get more help on the lecture material other than posting questions on Piazza. No live help on the lecture material was available.

Most projects are not challenging and the exams are checking your memorization instead of your understanding of the concepts. \n2. This course has some videos, but most of materials are only text-based which means you will have to read those materials. \n\nSo if you want to learn something, this is not a right course to take because you will likely not learn anything from it. And if you just want to take a course with less workload, I still don't recommend it because you will spend a ton of time to prepare for the exam. Overall, I think this course has a lot of opportunity to get better, but it was not a good experience for me. \nFYI, if you took CS61B and completed the homework for that course, you should feel this course projects pretty easy.

Some people reported spending as long as 20 hours on some assignments, so this will depend on how comfortable you are writing code.\n\nExams somewhat rely on memorization, although they are quite fair. I would say if you simply go through the lecture material once, you should be able to score ~70%. A few hours of review prior to the exam should get you close to the 100%. \n\nLecture videos are not worth spending time on. You will spend most of your time reading the lecture notes.

Other people probably found them easier than me.\n- Understanding some of the terminology / some of the demo/skeleton code that\u2019s given eats up a lot of start-up time\n- Autograder is unforgiving, so don\u2019t be a dummy like me for project 2 and not get every single test case perfectly \u2014 use all the test cases that are posted on Piazza. This was a learning moment for me.\n\n## Exams\n- Need more questions \u2014 for the volume of content that\u2019s covered, 20 - 25 questions is simply not enough to cover the meat & potatoes of it\n- Way too much of an impact on your grade from missing a couple of questions, which doesn\u2019t make sense\n- Sometimes felt like it was testing trivia rather than core concepts\n- Use flashcards to study\n\n## Workload\n- For me, was more than I had expected\n- You need to cover lectures, get the projects perfect, and study for exams\n- Adds up! Maybe 12-15 hours a week or so for me.\n\n# Summary\nThis is a decent class that covers interesting & applicable content. Most of the heavy lifting is done by the projects and a great TA team. The lectures are the worst aspect, and the professor is completely uninvolved with the class. I kept my expectations low going in, and ended up feeling pretty good about the overall experience.",

Topics such as firewalls, DNS, video streaming, routing algorithms are all covered. \n - Projects are pretty fun generally - writing python code to implement some networking functionality within a virtual network. Definitely need to be comfortable with Python and programming in general. Full-time engineers should have no issues with the projects. But it's best to start early, especially on the last project. \n - TAs were responsive on Piazza and helpful with projects\n - Straightforward exams\n\n## Cons\n- Professor was absent from the course - never seen or heard from her\n- The lectures were terrible - literally 2 minute videos of the professor reading verbatim from the lecture notes. Thankfully the lecture notes were also provided on the same page. After a few weeks I switched to just reading the notes and not watching the videos at all. The videos also have errors in them that are corrected in the notes. Overall a bad impression from the quality of the lectures. \n- Book was somewhat helpful but not entirely relevant. Also the course suggested getting the 7th edition but all the suggested reading references the 6th edition. Definitely rent the book if you get it, it does help a bit. \n\nThis was my first course in the OMSCS program and I enjoyed it as a good introductory course to computer networks. Especially recommend for someone out of school for a few years and needs to get back into the rhythm of studying, taking exams, etc because this class will help you with that without killing you. Overall if they simply overhauled the lecture videos I would rate this Strongly Liked. \n"

A super easy B, and an obtainable A (if you study for the exams).\n\nBoth my interest and existing experience were moderate.\n\nAssignments:\n70% projects, 30% exams. (7 projects, 3 exams). Small amount of extra credit available.\n\nProjects:\nThe projects are actually pretty good, but largely from an algorithms point of view. The ones that were actually network reports were pretty shallow, especially if you already have some network experience.\n\nThe course VM was not good, but they are looking at creating a new one. They sourced feedback on them from students as extra credit. Not much, but a good idea to engage user feedback.\n\nLectures:\nThe lectures are just not good. Networking is already quite dry. It could've at least been dressed up with some enthusiasm, images, real world examples, etc. As it is now, it's mostly just a video of the instructor as she reads flatly from the slides.\n\nSome of the content was wrong in the slides. This was sometimes noted in the transcripts below, not always, but is quite frustrating. I understand mistakes like this can happen, but these should be fixed. Most of the errors were small, but I noted a few.\n\nExams:\nExams were rote memorization. 25-30 multiple choice. Not terribly hard, but I find I don't do great on these exams. Median scores were low-to-high 80s.",

But not really, since the exams are a bit of a joke too.\n\nThere is a big opportunity missed in that the lectures don\u2019t make you apply anything. It would be nice to force you to truly apply the knowledge - with review questions of in some other way.\n\nThe projects were actually quite enjoyable. The programming aspects of them were super simple (as long as you know a little bit of python), but I found that they taught a lot. They provided structure and applied knowledge that the lectures lacked. The last project, regarding BGP hijacking, was the most interesting.\n\nThe TAs are great in this course. They were very hands on, and provided literally ALL of the instruction. The instructor herself didn\u2019t do anything at all, which is too bad since she seems quite accomplished and I feel like her experience would be valuable to learn from.\n\nOverall - I almost hate to say it but this course is worth taking for the projects and the TAs. I did learn quite a bit and while the slides were a drag, I think the projects were useful.",

I came into this course knowing that, but it didn't prepare me for the truth. Imagine a high school, that has no experience teaching online, is suddenly forced to create content within a week for students because of the pandemic. That's the level of effort they have put into these lectures. I have never seen a format that is so disengaging in my life. The lectures are just walls of texts, with a video in where the professor just reads it. THAT IS IT.

My background is a BS in Physics and 5 YoE in tech.\n\nThese are the pros and cons:\n\nPros:\n- TAs create a healthy environment to discuss concepts and share content.\n- The content is somewhat relevant and good to know.\n- Projects are good to some extent. All of them are old projects created by Dr. Feamster who has left Gatech, and I feel they're too similar to each other. There could have been projects, for example, on how to simulate a CDN or IXP, DNS loadbalancing, DDoS blackholing, or packet classification to name a few. \n\nCons:\n- Lectures created by Dr. Maria Konte are garbage. They are just a bunch of notes taken from the textbooks. I cannot even call them proper lectures. There are some videos here and there, but after the first few you just stick with the notes because they suck less. I realize that after Dr. Feamster's departure, some stuff had to be worked out impromptu. However, this has happened more than a year ago already. What was supposed to be temporary has become permanent and it's garbage.\n- Dr Konte is nowhere to be found. A common occurrence in OMSCS where classes are run by TAs who are also students in the program.\n- Too easy. Exams are not challenging, projects are not challenging (exception to extra credit part of Project 7, where discussions about it were forbidden on Piazza). This is not a graduate-level course.\n- Too much handholding. TAs and other students will share everything openly on Piazza. Even unqualified students can easily get away with an A since every answer to every project is out there (again, except for P7 Extra Credit) and there's so much extra credit available.\n\nJames Lohse, the head TA, did a great job. He was active throughout the entire semester, both on the projects' threads and replying to ad-hoc questions from students. He probably had 5x or more posts than all the other TAs combined. I feel he's truly altruistic and I wouldn't be able to be like him. After the first few stupid questions I would've given up being a TA and have taken another class instead.\n\nI don't recommend this class.",

                        "body": "Background: My bachelors was in electrical engineering, and I have ~1 year of work experience. This was my first OMSCS course.\n\nContent: The course content was very broad, and not terribly in-depth. As someone with limited background knowledge, I'd say the first and last parts of the course had the most interesting modules (the different network layers, and then discussing different applications like video streaming). The middle part of the course (routing and SDN) was absurdly boring to me, and studying for exam 2 was pretty painful because of it. Overall, as someone with limited formal CS background, I'd say I learned some interesting and useful topics. \n\nLectures: Pretty garbage, I never bothered watching the lecture videos (they're the lecture text, read out verbatim). The projects don't even really require you to have read the lectures, so I'd only read them all a few days before an exam. The suggested textbook is well written, though. \n\nExams (30%): Each exam was 20-25 questions, multiple choice/true-false/select the answers format. They weren't particularly difficult given the testing format, and if you don't know the answer for a question you can probably make an educated guess and be fine. Given the large amount of material covered for the class, there's no real targeted way to prepare for the exams other than reading all the lectures. The TAs provide a list of topics to study before each exam, but they're so broad as to be useless.\n\nProjects (70%): I have a solid grasp of Python, and I thought the projects were pretty easy. Even if you don't know Python, you'll probably be fine (you don't really need to know anything fancy for the projects). Projects 2 and 4 (the spanning tree and distance vector routing projects) were the most coding/algorithmically intensive of the bunch, but each one only took me a few hours to complete. For those two projects I recommend looking at Piazza for clear explanations of edge cases in the algorithm to implement, which makes the rest of the project really easy. I actually spent more time on the other projects, especially the ones which required a writeup. Projects 6 and 7 (the SDN firewall and BGP hijacking projects) were more tedious than anything else. Grading wasn't strict for the writeup projects, and in general if your code passes the test cases that people provide on Piazza, you'll get a 100% on each project. \n\nTAs: All the TAs (especially James) were very responsive on Piazza and Slack. I will say that, especially for project 7, the amount of secrecy that was enforced was kind of annoying. I personally didn't really need help for projects, but it was bizarre seeing posts removed for \"giving too much away\" when they were discussing completely trivial or arbitrary parts of the project. Also for project 7, I have no idea why \"determining which files to modify is part of the assignment\" so \"everyone needs to figure it out for themselves\" (isn't the focus of this course supposed to be about computer networks? This was just stupid, and felt like it was arbitrarily adding difficulty to the assignment) \n\nTime commitment: Most weeks I didn't have to even think about this course. Whenever projects were released I'd get them done right away, and exams only took a night or two to study for. Since I was only reading the lectures before exams, that left a lot of free time. This would be a good course to take over the summer or pair up with another.\n\nOverall: Rather easy and laidback course, even with limited background knowledge. \n\n\n",

Very responsive on Piazza and Slack.\n\nProjects: 7.5/10. The practical coding projects were a fun challenging assignments.  The research paper assignments give step by step guidance on replicating the work, and do not feel challenging, especially for a graduate level course.  You usually have a two week window to complete projects.\n\nExams: 9/10.  Straightforward, cut and dry questions.  Most students collaborated on reviews before the exams.  There is a week-long window per exam, and no other material or assignments during exam weeks, so it was fairly easy to review a lesson a day, then spend Friday/ Saturday reviewing everything or taking the test.\n\nDifficulty: 2/10. There were weeks when I literally didn't have to touch the class.  If you have a CS background, expect to spend 5-10 hours on a project.  My undergrad CN course was honestly much more difficult.  If you don't have a CS background, spend some time with Python and OOP before class starts.  I paired this class with AI4R/RAIT.",

It is not that that the content itself is poor (its interesting), its the way it is presented - the lectures are not actually lectures, they are webpages of text! (with the odd video sprinkled in, which basically repeats the text provided)\n\nTAs: 9/10. They are excellent, provide lots of support, are attentive on Piazza. Very impressed.\n\nProjects: 8/10. The practical coding projects (implementing algorithms) are a lot of fun and I really enjoyed them. The written ones are a little drier (as to be expected), but still have practical elements and cover interesting topics.\n\nExams: 8/10. Multiple choice, True/False etc. Not hugely difficult if you take some time to revise the content. TAs provide an exam guide to help you do this as well.\n\nDifficulty: 5/10. If you have any sort of programming background (even if only academic) and have done a networking course, you will be able to get through this without issue. If you have never looked at code before - you will likely find this a lot more challenging as the heavier weighted projects are coding based - look at Python, make sure you understand object oriented programming concepts, a basic knowledge in both areas will greatly simplify your understanding of the projects.\n\nIf you know networking and programming (especially Python) to an undergraduate extent - this course will be straightforward and can be paired. If you have done no programming - I would recommend a Python/OOP course before you start as that will make things a lot smoother for you with the coding projects.\n\nAlso a note - Mininet (the VM many complain about) - is not that bad if you pay attention to the instructions and information provided. It is old (Python 2.7!) and does need updating, but it does the job :-)",

The only downside is the frustrating VM, which is a pain to set up for the first time.\n\nTake-Aways: A breath of knowledge about OSI Model, Congestion Control for TCP, Routing Algorithms and Protocols (BGP), Software-Defined-Networking (SDN), Internet Security (DDoS attacks, BGP Hijack Attacks), and Censorship (in China). \n\nThis is not an \"Advanced Networking\" course. It is an Intro. You won't find it challenging if you know a bit of Python to complete the given Projects. \n\nI liked the course, in particular, the content about SDN, Security, and Censorship was interesting (but not practical for a software engineer).\n\nTips:\n\nWatch the office hours, or you won't be able to answer the projects.\n\nYou probably don't need to watch the lectures to understand the material. Just print the transcripts, and memorize them for the exams.\n\nThe summer version is shorter and covers less material and has fewer projects, which is unfortunate because the projects complement the material.",

                        "body": "This is by far the worst OMSCS course I\u2019ve taken so far and the only one I regret taking after 9 courses.\n\nI already took a computer networks course during my undergrad, so in terms of difficulty this course is an easy A for anybody with the same background. However, the lectures are so unengaging and the material so dry that it becomes hard to keep up with it.\n\nAs some reviewers mentioned, the lectures are in Canvas and there are two types: some that have videos and transcript text accompanying it and others that are just text:\n* The video-lectures are simply horrible. I get that the new videos are not recorded in the Udacity studios, but any random Youtube video about the topic uses teaching resources more effectively than these, where the professor simply reads in the most boring tone possible a text over a mostly static slide. There are no hands, no pointer, no arrows... so is very easy to get lost in what she is referring to. Another point is, why substituting the old ones by something that is clearly subpar quality? The new ones just make the old ones shine, and that's quite serious taking into account that the old ones were already considered poor compared to other OMSCS classes.\n* The lectures where there's just text don't improve much. Lessons change topic from one page to another without a minimal introduction, the text is full of typos, erratas, and acronyms are not properly introduced... The formatting is also bad, where formulas or important topics are not even bolded and are just thrown in the middle of the sentence in plane text. Looks more like someone's notes from a CN class than a real class material. Graphs and other resources are mostly copied directly from Kurose and other books (introducing some errors here and there).\n\nOne blatant example of the errors mentioned and how little the professor cares about the class was in the lecture where TCP Cubic is discussed, in which the diagram in what the entire explanation is based on was mistaken. This caused misunderstandings in the students, but what is worse is that this had already been detected in the previous semester and it hasn't been solved yet! The TAs explained that the professor was already aware and working on it, but really, 2 semesters for solving this? That was why OMSCS has been migrating to Canvas and Kaltura for, right?\n\nRegarding the projects, we had 5:\n- #1 Mininet\n- #2 Spanning Tree protocol\n- #3 Buffer bloat\n- #4 SDN\n- #5 BGP Hijacking\n\nI am not going to review them since many people already did. From my point of view, they were ok-ish. Projects 2 and 3 where the only ones corresponding to a graduate level course. 1, 4 and 5 in my opinion were not. All of them were based in a deprecated VM and Python 2.7. They are already showing its age and they need to be (properly) refreshed.\n\nI would recommend anybody considering this course to stay away from it until is really revamped.",

I think those are going to be useful in the rest of my time at GT.\n\nThe other reviews are right that the lectures are pretty boring. I also stopped watching them after the first few.\n\nBut I really liked this course and am glad I took it.\n\n## Ideal audience for this course\n\n* already knows the mechanics of TCP, IP, AIMD, etc.\n* interested in security\n\n## What I knew/did going in that was useful\n\n* Stanford undergrad online course in networks\n* decent Python along with 3 years being a Java web developer\n* decent Linux abilities from my current job in devops\n\n## Some annoying things\n\n* The course VM is ancient and it seemed like it caused a lot of people problems getting set up. I had problems on the last project getting things to run at first, but it turned out it was somehow due to running the application out of a directory that was shared with my host os. That was something they told us not to do at the beginning.\n* The assignments are kind of hard to read. They feel like there's been a lot of copy/paste and could basically use a rewrite from scratch.\n\n## Pro tips\n\n* it's easily possible to get an A by getting full credit on the assignments and getting 70-80% on the exams. I did read through all the lectures as they were assigned while taking notes, and then just reviewed my notes to answer the helpful study guide questions the TAs provided for a couple of hours before taking the tests.\n* the extra credit threads aren't worth very much but the extra credit on the final homework is worth a lot. That'd be the place to try to get points back if you need it\n* if they haven't changed the slide deck they use for what is Project 5 in the summer or Project 7 in the long semesters, the diagram doesn't represent the starter code or anything in reality at all!! I probably added an 1 hour per week to my estimate just because of all the time I wasted trying to understand how that diagram could possibly relate to what was in the starter code.\n"

But the exams includes single choice (2-5 options), multiple choice, T/F, which is somewhat harder than just multiple choice. TAs are responsive and helpful, piazza is the place to learn, professor didn't show up.\n\nThis course is a good course pair with other harder courses. But don't expect to learn alot from it. ",

                        "body": "As mentioned in other reviews, the lecture material is pretty dry. If you want to listen to the professor read from a script in a monotone voice, then this is your class. It's a bit upsetting since this course recently got a face lift. So I doubt the lectures will change much in the near future. Also, Professor Konte was completely absent. On a Piazza post about lecture material, a TA said they would leave the question for Professor Konte to answer. No answer. Crickets.\n\nThe two good things about this course were that it was a light workload (some weeks, I genuinely forgot it was happening which is insane for a summer course) and that the TAs were pretty responsive. I like that they nipped duplicate and unreasonable questions on Piazza and slack. We had one person in particular who was extremely rude and just word vomited in slack and that was actively discouraged by TAs and students, which was nice. Also the grading TA (TAs?) was amazing. We were told that for P4, he checked your submission manually if it gets below an autograded 100. The average was high! The only complaint about TAs is that since it's summer, there are fewer projects and there was a lot of confusion because instructions/file names for a normal fall/spring semester P7 project was not changed to P5 (which is what it is for the summer). It'd be nice if there was a little more attention to detail for the summer session since it's different from the others.\n\nThe projects were enjoyable and low maintenance but I honestly don't think you need to watch the lectures to get them done. The first project is the easiest - they literally give you each command you have to run. The remaining ones were fun and took probably 5-10 hours for each of varying difficulty.\n\nThe exam study guides were overall helpful but it'd be nice if they finished writing the exam before they posted it as it had some nonsensical questions. One thing I don't get about this class is why exam grades aren't immediately available. Not the exam feedback but just your numeric grade. The questions are all multiple choice/multiple answer so it's a bit mind boggling that you don't get your grades back right away. I get ProctorTrack flags violations and it takes a while to clear these flags but it'd be nice if you could at least have your numeric score.\n\nOverall, not a bad course but not really worth the time. If you do take it, I don't think recommend it outside of the summer session as, I believe, there are more required lectures, projects, and another exam.",

This is a way that I struggle to learn. The assignments are boring and uninspired. All of the code you write you likely will never have to worry about or think about again unless you will specifically work in networking. The ideas will also be irrelevant unless you specifically work in networking.\n\nI am going to end the course with a B because I am having immense trouble studying for the exams. Not because the material is difficult, but because in order to study you have to do nothing but read the lectures (not videos or any sort of good presentation to learn) and this is simply not how I learn. This material is easily the worst that I have learned in my now 4th class in the OMSCS program. I have previously taken ML4T, AI4R, and Software Testing (I forget that courses actual name).\n\nI am going to walk away from this course having learned nothing.

                        "body": "We're only about 3/4 through the course, but I feel that's enough to give a (somewhat) comprehensive review of the course.\n\n### Projects\n\nFor the summer section of this course, there are a total of 5 projects--not including the extra credit project that is part of project #5.\n\nIn these projects, we've conducted experiments with the Mininet virtual networking software and written Python implementations of network device functionality. In my opinion, the projects did a fine job of testing us on information we covered in the lessons and demanded we put forth an actual effort. For the projects that required some amount of programming, there are students that have shared test harnesses that helped validate that outputs are matching what's expected. So as long as you follow instructions *exactly* as outlined and meet the rubric requirements, you should score well. Make sure you do, because projects are 70% of the overall grade.\n\n### Lesson Content\n\nAs others have mentioned, the \"lectures\" are mostly one of the following:\n1. the instructor reading a paraphrased excerpt of the text\n2. a paraphrased digest of content from the book or a research paper\n3. #1 and/or #2, but with pictures\n\nThere were also a number of distracting typos, sentence fragments, and tiny (but crucial) bits of information omitted/missing; sometimes, students would mention this in Slack and find out the answer to their questions by directly referencing the book. However, it's worth noting that our cohort is the second group to take this newer version of CS-6250. I understand, though, that the TAs and instructor are actively working to address these errors; because of this, I can forgive the current course quality (or lack thereof).\n\n### Logistics\n\nDespite there being hundreds of students enrolled in this course, the TAs have been fairly quick to respond to any inquiries or grievances in Slack and Piazza. The head TA, in particular, is doing a kick-ass job of keeping on top of things. I don't have much else to say here.\n\n### Exams\n\nThe exams are multiple choice and test your knowledge of the topics covered in readings. There aren't really any *GOTCHA* questions... just some conceptual stuff that you *should* retain if you've done the reading. Partial credit is given for questions where more than one answer can be selected. I did not really study extensively for exam 1 and still scored an 83%. In retrospect, if I put in slightly more effort (flash cards, full re-read of my notes), I *know* I would've scored at least 95%. At the time of writing, we have not yet received exam 2. It will follow a similar format and cover the remaining lessons (i.e., not cumulative), though, so I'm not expecting any surprises. Each exam for the summer section is worth 15% of the total grade. Even if you do \"OK\" on the exams, you can still pass with an A.\n\nAll-in-all, this course has been a pleasant experience. I'm taking this between working full-time and taking care of two toddlers in the evenings. I've committed 1~3 hours daily to read and take notes. Maybe an additional hour or two, within project time windows. The course is not extremely challenging, but it's not totally easy either. I'd recommend it as a first class to \"prime\" yourself for OMSCS or if you happen to have an interest in some low-level concepts in computer networking.",

Maybe it is because the course content is a little bit dry. But the TAs are very nice and scores are not bad.

                        "body": "As a network engineer myself, I think this course covers a broad array of modern topics very well.  It targets algorithms, protocols and software that modern network infrastructures deploy today; 1\" deep and 6' wide.  I come across these topics in my currently role frequently, and this course helped me understand the software aspects of the systems I manage.  I don't think this course is geared towards making you a network engineer; it is hard to be a competent network engineer without dozens, if not hundreds, of hours of exposure to BGP, OSPF and MPLS.  This course is geared towards providing a skillset for software engineers who may work in the networking domain.  For instance, FANG companies have hundreds of hybrid engineers who have a mixture of networking and software skillsets to support their global infrastructures.  It's worth noting that even if you're an aspiring network engineer, the traditional network engineer, who is a hardcore BGP expert, is becoming obsolete (software skills are needed)\n\nAs far as projects go, the spanning-tree project (project 2) was the hardest but also my favorite.  I use to troubleshoot spanning-tree issues in the past, so I enjoyed building the algorithm from the ground up and seeing it operate instead.   If you make it past this project, 12-16 hours in two weeks, it's downhill from here.  I thought the BGP section was too elementary and didn't provide much exposure to the most critical protocol in networking.  I also think the firewall lab (project 7 I think) should be changed.  The assignment wasn't difficult but it did take a lot of time.  It was Mininet that was just a total pain.  You'd have to reset your \"device\" each time you made a firewall policy change.  This made it so difficult to do penetration testing.  It'd be better to use a vendor VM than to have students hamstringed by Mininet (for this assignment).  The professor did a great job of diluting the books into small chunks that we could grasp within a few minutes.  If I was more curious about something, I would reference the book or whitepapers (which I did frequently).  She deserves a lot of credit and her notes will make great references in the future.  TCP is such a complex protocol but she did so well with it.  Kudos to her!  \n\nP.S. Being comfortable in Python or knowing OOP is a must.  ",

Even without that experience, I was able to do well in the class. The content per exam is reasonable and I was able to study with flash cards starting a few days before. I received A's on all exams. \n\nThe assignments are a mix of coding projects and research. I ended up failing the first project because I hadn't realized how differently the auto grader was than the test scenarios. The key to the programming projects is test with every example provided by students in Piazza and contribute your own test cases to the class. I was able to make all of the points up through the semester because of the amount of opportunities, both assignment count and extra credit.  The only project I disliked was the last. It had an interesting premise, but there are issues with a SDN tool that was used called Mininet. There are a lot of false negatives due to the need for continuous reboot of both your Mininet network and the VM.\n\nIf you do struggle, the TAs for this class were pretty good outside of the TA assigned to the last project. If you message the Instructors privately in Piazza, be sure to give at least a week of time. It took about 3-4 days for them to get back.\n\nAll-in-all it was an okay class. I don't necessarily feel any more skilled because of it, but it was a reasonable class. I was able to pair this with another class while I worked full time.",

In a typical Fall/Spring semester there are 7 projects that mostly run on two-week schedules, so be prepared to keep up your momentum throughout the semester. Some projects are more difficult than others, I had particular trouble with the last one (COVID-19 and family issues definitely had an impact there) but most can be completed in a few evenings during the week. In addition to the projects, there are 3 exams (multiple choice) that aren\u2019t too difficult if you watch/read the provided lectures, and the TAs this semester were very reasonable about considering giving points to contested questions.\n\nThe worst part by far were the lectures. No textbooks were required, but the Canvas lectures (new for this semester) comprised of both videos, text, and diagrams that cover a variety of concepts. They offer modern and thorough information on the subject, but are among the dullest of the 9 courses I\u2019ve taken. The professor\u2019s tone is quite monotone and it\u2019s sometimes hard to understand how concepts are fitting together until you take notes in your own words and tie them together yourself.\n\nThere are multiple opportunities to earn extra credit throughout the semester, but I neglected to take them up on the offer since I was busy with another course as well. This is definitely manageable as a 2nd course while working full-time, as long as the other course is of similar difficulty. If you keep up with the schedule and give each project a shot, you\u2019ll do well in this course.",

                        "body": "# TL;DR\n\nProjects are ok.  Content is good.  Instruction is lacking.  Very beta quality.\n\n# Lectures/Instruction\n## Dr. Konte\nWhile Dr. Konte is no doubt experienced and knowledgable in her field, there is no way to know that, since the only time you'll see her is the videos of the class, which are few.  That is to say, not every \"slide\" or section of the class has a corresponding video and to my knowledge she is completely absent otherwise.  (There could have been office hours with her and I missed them, but I never did see her there, nor slack, nor Piazza.)\n\nInstead, there is a text section for the slides with generally a reference to the relevant section of the book (Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach, Kurose and Ross, 7th ed).  My advice to anyone taking this course is to scroll down to that at the end of the slide and read those sections and avoid the slides and videos completely.\n\nThe slides are transcriptions of the videos (where they exist) which are basically Dr. Konte reading that section of the book.  The diagrams in the slides are also direct copies from the book.  I wonder what sort of \"ethics\" investigations would be levied against me if I turned in such blatant copying.\n\nDr. Konte's accent is not much of a barrier, but she appears to be very nervous in front of a camera, leading to a bit of monotone. As a monotone speaker myself I sympathize, but some practice here would go a long way.\n\nOverall, we got no benefit from Dr. Konte.  Surely she was hired for some expertise in the field, and/or she wanted to actually teach and give us the benefit of that?  We saw none.\n\n## TAs\n\nI felt the TA staff was very good.  Responsive on slack, open to criticism on exams, plenty of office hours, willing to go in whatever direction the discussions wanted to go.  One criticism I had is they spent way, WAY too much time telling us how hard exam questions are to come up with.  Ok, we get it, it's hard, but none of us paying for this service really cares that much about how difficult the thing is we pay you to do.\n\n# Content\n\nThe book is great.  I do have a high level background in networking but the book goes into a lot more detail and explanation of things I'd only heard about and knew the acronyms for.  For what I do a lot of that detail will probably never be used by me (sort of like calculus), but at least I know more than I did and I know where to look to find out more if I need to.\n\nI will probably be reading more chapters in the book than the class covered, just because it's interesting, well written, and useful.\n\nAs I mentioned, I can only say good things about the content of the *book* because the class/lecture content was basically nothing more than that.\n\n# Projects\n\nThere were 7; I'm told there are fewer in the Summer.  5 were programming involved, 2 were \"run this - describe what you see\" type.  I enjoyed them overall, but there were a few issues that I'll describe below in a bit more detail.\n\nIn general, I feel that projects should be something that mimics the types of things one would be doing in a real job, or to illustrate a point (like re-inventing something to see how its made).  The projects BY AND LARGE did this.\n\nTactically, they're all python, but not complex python so no great study of the language is required.\n\n# Exams\n\nI was very neutral to disappointed on the (3) exams.  I'm not sure if it was the second language issue, or that this semester was the \"beta\" version of the class content and instructor or what, but there seemed to be way too many questions that were overly vague.  We got a non-trivial amount of points back on all 3 because of bad questions, and at least on exam 3 not even for vagueness; one was just absolutely graded wrong.  Mistakes happen, but after all the anguish displayed about how hard exams are to make, it doesn't seem like enough review time was given to any of them.\n\nTactically, there were 3 (none of them cumulative), all fewer than 30 questions.  I feel this isn't nearly enough for a class of this scope.  Either more exams, or more questions.  Most of the time taken on the exam was trying to parse what they were asking given the possible answers, which is testing neither knowledge or understanding of the content of the class.\n\nFor example, exam 3 had 20 questions, 2 of which were on CBR vs VBR; not networking.  I found this to have almost shockingly missed the point of the section; 10% of an entire exam on non-networking content.  Entire papers and sections we studied were completely missed.\n\n# Misc\nThere were a number of miscellaneous issues I'd like to go over here.\n\n## Infrastructure\nThis is perhaps the most egregious downside of this class, although I fear it is more of a university-wide issue.  The infrastructure of the class with respect to the projects is ... godawful.  The VM used some bizarrely curated version of Ubuntu that was ~6 years old with a window manager setup that I'm sure catered to someone, sometime, but is not quite like anything anyone would install.  Just use a stock image with the apps/libs pre-installed required for the projects!  We really don't need your special snowflake window manager setup and background.\n\nIn the VM, we used \"mininet\" to do a variety of software defined networking tasks.  Mininet is brittle and very twitchy, so you never know if the issues you're having are your own code, or the infrastructure.\n\nMininet is based on python 2.7, a version which was released 11 years ago, and completely end-of-lifed I believe either before the semester started, or very nearly so.  END-OF-LIFEd.  Not even security updates.  For a class that is at least part of the *Cybersecurity* degree.  For a University with the reputation of Ga Tech, it strains credulity that we're stuck with this tech.  I get that it's not new-shiny-sexy to keep students up to date, but gruntwork still needs to be done.\n\nThe quality of the project documentation and provided code was... average, for a beginning python developer.  The code quality was not great; at least one had mixed spaces and tabs, there were numerous typos and misspellings, code commented out that was presumably meant to be deleted, but just overlooked which caused a lot of questions on slack.  Overall, not something that would be anywhere near \"production quality\", which I feel is necessary as this is a product for which you have paying customers.\n\n## \"gotcha\"\nLike other classes in this program, the projects seem to be TA written.  The quality, format, and overall \"feel\" of every project is wildly different.  But one thing they all have in common is an almost religious fervor adding some magic nugget \"gotcha\" to keep people from cheating by using previous semester's student's work.  I get it, cheating is bad, and copying code is easy, but so much work is devoted to stopping this that not a lot of work is put into actually making a project that teaches something useful.\n\nIn one project they tried to 'simplify' an algorithm by making \"-99\" be an end state; if you got to -99 for this thing, you could consider it done.  That sounds fine, but for 2 bad side-effects:\n\n1. -99 doesn't occur in real life.  No one in this class will ever use the special code they wrote to handle this case, ever again.  It's throwaway nonsense.\n2. Almost amusingly, 99% of the issues about this project discussed in slack where around this artificial and never-before-nor-again seen constraint.\n\nSo what this means is that instead of learning about the algorithm, we spent inordinate time on this constraint that we'll never see again.  Horrible idea and I hope no student ever sees it again.\n\nA better choice would have been to split the project into 2 pieces; 1 piece doesn't use a network topography that requires this constraint.  This would teach how the algorithm works.  The part 2 would be to see how to handle the very real life issue that the -99 was meant to address, but IN THE WAY IT'S ACTUALLY HANDLED.  It isn't that hard, no more difficult than what we were asked to do, and might actually prepare someone for life outside academia.\n\n## Lecture Release\n\nThe lectures were released on a weekly schedule.  This means you couldn't study ahead.  Not only that, they were released late too many times (at least one week as late as Wednesday).\n\nI don't know if they weren't ready on time (in which case, why was the class provided at all?) or some weird power play by the staff, or what, but it was very irritating, and frankly not what we paid for.\n\nI understand this happened during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, but at least once the TA's said the late releases were due to Dr. Konte being the SOLE ENTITY that could click the button release a module, and she was busy trying to get things organized/ready/??? for the on-campus students.  So I see where we stand.\n\nThe online program just feels more and more like a money-grab; push out videos, ride that train as long as possible and maximize the revenue flow.\n",

My two main gripes with it are that the lectures were very poorly done and the course itself was too easy and shallow. \n\nAs other reviewers noted, not all the lectures have videos, and when they did, it seemed like the professor was just reading straight off a piece of paper. Fortunately, for the video lectures, they had the text of the lecture below the video, so I typically just read that instead. Unfortunately though, I often found the lecure/texts confusing and unclear - it seemed like the professor was trying to summarize the textbook in a way that it\u2019s easier to understand, but I just found it more confusing, as acronyms and concepts were mentioned without being introduced, and it seemed like the professor was trying to make these lectures as short as possible. I suggest just reading the textbook instead. It is rare that I can say a textbook is less dry than a lecture, and these lectures pale in comparison to something like the fantastic ML or RL lectures. Before the course, I had started watching the Udacity version of the Computer Networks lectures, and while the new lectures have a little more professional flair with some nice graphics, the old ones were much more engaging, so I\u2019m not sure at all why they re-did them.\n\nMy other issue is the class is just too easy. In one way, this is good, as I wanted to take an easier class this semester, but it really feels like an Undergrad class, and I would\u2019ve preferred to learn a little bit more. Just do the projects, which are almost spoon-fed to you, as the instructions explain almost everything, make sure you at least somewhat understand the lectures, and you should get an A. There were 7 projects, and each one took me less than 5 hours, and lectures each week I\u2019d estimate at being less than an hour, so the workload is very very light. Yes I wanted an easy class, but I would\u2019ve preferred the topics to be more in depth.\n\nAlso, since this was the first semester they were running the re-done course, there were mistakes here and there and some unclear parts of assignments and exams. Fortunately I\u2019ll say the TAs and professor were good about doing regrades and fixing any issue.\n\n**Take this course if** you want an easy A and want to learn some computer networking basics.\n\n**Don\u2019t take this course** if you want to learn as much as possible in this program and take classes that are a good value. If you want to learn Computer Networks, I feel like it would be more interesting and faster to just pick a random Coursera course or read the textbook (Computer Networking by Kurose and Ross).\n"

Projects were interesting and different (coding, experiment, papers), which was fun. They weren't big but I found them somewhat challenging and involving. Very useful to read assigned papers and books because lectures were mostly based from them, so reading extra helped to learn the content and memorize it.",

If you know Python, basic programming concepts like for loops, and know how to follow directions from the project PDFs, you'll be good. It's the perfect class to pair with a harder one, if you want to take 2 in one semester. (To be fair, my job gives me half the week to only work on school).\n\nMaterial:\nI'm not a die-hard networking fan, but the material discussed was interesting enough not to make me bored. I guess because there's new material, not all modules have a video lecture and only have text and visualizations, which I didn't mind at all.\n\nProjects:\nThere are 7, and they seem to rotate between programming projects (all Python), and research/experimentation projects (no coding, just write a report). I probably spent less than 6 hours on each project (doing the last one now).\n\nExams:\nThere are 3, non-cumulative. I really like the timing of them. There's not an overwhelming amount of material to study for each exam, which I find makes the subject matter stick better, since I'm not cramming my brain 3 months worth of lecture material. \n\nI'm horrible at studying (i.e., I just wing it most times) and I got a 65-75 on the last two tests (bonus if you have people in the class who argue why their answer is correct and the teacher agrees and gives the point; my grade on the first test bumped to a low B because of this). Even with my poor test scores, my final grade so far is in the high 90s because I've gotten full points on the projects so far. (Projects and tests are weighted the same (10%), but there are more projects than tests).\n\nHope this helps someone make the decision to take this class. I'm enjoying it. Shout out to the Professor and TAs, who are active in Piazza!",

The time spent was actually not because there was a lot of coding to do but rather figuring out the approach to use to solve the problem. TA's did a good job of providing guidance on the projects during the office hours. There are other posts that have described the projects + amount of time + the approx number of lines of code (if any )needed etc.\n\nOverall I enjoyed the class especially getting introduced to SDN (Software Defined Networking). \n\nNever heard a word from the professor.",

All good stuff. I was surprised how much of networking is just a subset of algorithms - minimum spanning trees, bellman ford, etc..\n\nTo do well in this course, it is all about the projects which are about 70% of the grade. A few of the projects are time consuming and kind of difficult, but very doable. For some labs, there are test classes that if your project passes the tests, you are probably going to pass the auto grader. The class does not seem to pull any tricky punches such as weird test questions or testing strange edge cases that you didn't think to test. It is pretty above board and honest. \n\nYou should be able to get a B on the exams just by watching the lectures and then reviewing your notes. A's seem harder to come by for tests, but doing well on the projects will make up for it.\n\nThere is extra credit, but felt like a bit of a hassle given amount of points available and the effort, but might be helpful in a pinch. \n\nPiazza was very helpful for clarifying confusion on the labs.\n\nMost of the difficulty of the labs surrounded reading a large python project and understanding what it was actually doing and what you needed to modify to get it working. Even though I did labs on Bellman-Ford and MST, it felt like most of the effort was understanding the project code and not so much the underlying algorithms. \n\nThis is a good first year course and you will learn some key networking concepts you can take with you in your career.   \n\n",

I believe this was a well-rounded course and good intro to the OMSCS program with a combination of coding assignments, paper readings, and ProctorTrack tests.\n\n### Recommendations\n\n- Take this class if you've never taken a formal networking course.\n- To get the **A**, focus on acing the assignments; they will give you a huge buffer for the tricky tests.\n- Don't worry about the details in the assigned papers: Abstract, Introduction, Results, & Conclusion is enough.\n- Ignore the EC assignments; they're way harder & not worth the effort.\n\n### Prerequisites\n\nBasic knowledge of Python syntax (string formatting, classes, lists, dictionaries) would be useful, but not necessary.\n\nI don't think any networking knowledge is required to take the course; everything can be learned during the class with the (optional) textbook.\n\n### Workload\n\nWorkload is light. I spent ~2 hours per week taking notes on lectures. I spent ~5-10 hours on each of the course's 7 two-week assignments. The big time sink for me was the research paper readings due to my lack of experience with formal papers.\n\nThe course is front-loaded in assignment difficulty with two algorithm-based assignments, but back-loaded with papers (4 for the first and second tests, 8 for the third test).\n\n### Lectures & Readings\n\nI enjoyed the lectures. Professor Feamster (no longer at GT) did a great job presenting the material with great illustrations.\n\nThe readings were hit-or-miss. Some were interesting, like the Google TCP Fast-Open and the Jellyfish Data Center papers. Others seemed downright pointless, and many never showed up in an assignment or test.\n\n### Assignments\n\nThe assignments were mixed. Although they were generally interesting and relevant, the programming is all outdated Python 2.7 and some of the other technologies (Pyretic specifically) are also deprecated. The most challenging part was digesting the large instruction documents to understand _exactly_ what was required.\n\nThe median grade on all assignments was 100%.\n\n### Tests\n\nThe tests were tricky with means of 83%, 80%, and 76%. They were generally short (<30 questions) with the majority of questions as multi-choice, multi-answer type. For me, this type of question is frustrating because I frequently ended up flipping a coin on half-truths due to ambiguous wording.\n\n### Grading\n\n- 70% assignments\n- 30% tests\n- 6% extra credit opportunity\n\nThe assignments are relatively easy, while the tests and extra credit are relatively hard.\n",

There are also assigned readings; early in the semester I would pore over these papers multiple times and fully absorb the information, but after the first (and especially second) exam I realized that only a cursory glance through each paper is enough to get what you need out of them.\n\nThe projects are fairly interesting and cover a wide range of topics. Depending on your programming/algorithm skills a couple of the projects will take you either one/two hours to complete, or a few hours a night for a couple weeks (these projects involve graph-traversal algorithms used by routers and switches). The other projects consist mainly of using a network virtualization tool to emulate network topologies, firewalls, and administrator configurations.\n\nThe material covered by the exams is interesting, but not particularly difficult. We went over traffic shaping, network security, large-scale networking (i.e. ISP's connecting and communicating with one another), and other topics that are a \"deeper dive\" than an undergrad networking course would go. Some of the research papers were very interesting (such as Google's \"TCP Fast-Open\" research) but many of them were so dry I had to make multiple attempts at staying interested.\n\nI took this course mainly because my undergrad Networking professor was more interested in telling stories about being a former cop than actually teaching, and so I wanted to strengthen my knowledge in this area. I was expecting a more rigorous, intense version of an undergrad course to fill the gaps in my knowledge, but this course is more of a continuation of a typical undergrad networking course than anything (i.e. you're expected to already be familiar with the ins and outs of the OSI model, inner workings of TCP, etc.). As a software engineer at my day job, I do not think I will ever use 90% of what is taught in this course unless I pivot my career to becoming a network administrator, but the topics are nonetheless interesting.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this course if it's your first semester in the program, if you need just one more easy elective to knock out, or if you want to double up with another light class and need something that won't take much of your time and energy.",

                        "body": "### Overview\n\nThis course is well structured and not too demanding, which is helpful if you come in without an undergrad level background in networking. I spent a lot of time in the beginning of the course reading the recommended textbook to catch up and still had time to do all the assignments. I expected this class to be boring but surprisingly learned a lot, some of which was pretty interesting. It was definitely satisfying to learn more about how the internet works and get more familiar with HTTP status codes and things I had seen in passing. \n\n### Course Content and Assignments \nClass is divided into 3 parts: basic networking, traffic engineering, and security. The first is basically a review of undergrad networking material while the latter parts go over research topics building on the basic concepts. Lectures cover the highlights of the conceptual material presented in the required research paper readings or the textbook for the basic networking concepts. Assignments focus on one or two specific aspects from the lectures and go more in depth. All assignments provide plenty of support in terms of provided skeleton code (Python), directions, and TA help so that you can easily complete the  assignment within the 2 week time frame. If you are new to programming this course is still doable. Although the assignments are not that hard, spending time to build a concrete understanding of the problem and your intended solution before starting the code will save you from having to track down odd, extremely specific errors. I typically spent the first week watching lectures/reading papers, 2-3 days exploring the provided code and typing up my solution, 1 day coding, and 1 day debugging. Other people jumped on the code much earlier, but from the Piazza discussions some of them spent hours tracking down bugs, so decide where you want to spend your time.\n\n#### Assignment List\n1. Basic tasks with Mininet\n2. Programming a Spanning Tree Protocol Algorithm\n3. Programming a Distance-Vector Routing Algorithm\n4. Experimental evaluation of TCP Fast Open vs Standard TCP\n5. Experimental evaluation of buffer bloat and congestion control algorithms\n6. Programming a Software-Defined Network Firewall\n7. BGP Hijacking configuration and extra credit opportunity (5%, 3 weeks instead of 2)\n\n### Tests\nTests are multiple choice and use ProctorTrack. They are pretty straightforward and your biggest risk is overcomplicating the question. Tests comprise 30% of the total grade. There is up to 1% total extra credit if you participate in the three optional discussion threads which each involve an extra reading. With the 5% from project 7, you have up to 6% extra credit possible in the class.\n\n### TL;DR\nGood class if you're new to networking or programming. If you need to do a bit of catch-up on either there's time during the course for it. Both basic and research topics in networking are covered. Projects and exams not too difficult, especially if you take the time to understand the concepts before jumping in to the solution. This class can teach beginners a fair amount without unnecessary pain.",

In hindsight, taking this class before IOS would have been better idea, because many of the basic networking concepts learned in this class would have saved me a lot headache in starting IOS.\n\nThat being said, most of the lasting concepts I learned from this class were not directly from the lecture material, but from the paper readings and other background readings on this topic.\n\nThe video lecture presentations could use some TLC.\n\nI found the projects to be mostly fun and well-designed, though I would have preferred to have had fewer projects and have each one be more in-depth.\n\nI did find myself doing relatively well in this class despite my lack of understanding in some of the course content. I can implement spanning tree algorithms ok, but this doesn't equate to understanding how the transport layer truly works. I do wonder if there's a way to improve the teaching of the material so that students HAD to understand these concepts to get a good grade. I would feel more satisfied by this course if this were the case.\n\nFinally, computer networking just feels like a very applied area in computer science. There's very minimal math to speak of. Research results are quite empirical. This does detract from the learning experience, at least for me, even though these topics do seem very critical to understand.",

I was not a fan of the lectures by the previous professor who left Georgia Tech for Princeton a few years back (and now at UChicago). Something about the cadence of his speech made following the lectures harder than it should be, and the way the slides were presented was basically him just free drawing diagrams, which for a complicated diagram made it messy to view and necessitated a couple of rewatches (though I had his lectures usually on 1.5x speed to smooth out the cadence of the speech).\n\nThe tests were drawn largely from the lectures (except for the 3rd and final test, which had more elements from the papers we had to read). \n\nThe projects 2,3 and to a lesser extent project 7 were the big ones that required 2-3 days (for a total of 10-15 hours) to finish for me (not a professional SWE), and at the time, somewhat new to Python (just did a Codecademy course on Python). \n\nEnded up with over a 100% grade in the course, because of extra credit assignments or tasks. Should be a decent 1st course to take in OMSCS, but I heard Prof Konte was overhauling this course a bit since I took it.",

When I worked 5 more hours for the final project, they commended me for having the best writeup in class for that project. I also got full points for extra credit.\n\nOn my part, I still have a lot of shortcomings like not going through the Stanford Computer Networking course or reading any Computer Networking book. That would have helped me get through the course easily, and do well with the tests.\n\nI find the professor Maria Konte to be great. Read her papers. I don't think have great expectations but it's great we have someone like her who's credible in this field of Networking & Security research. \n\n\nFor those who want to learn more about Networking & feel like focusing on Computing Systems in general, read this thread:\n\nhttps://github.com/ossu/computer-science/issues/520",

The projects were poorly explained with some sample youtube videos that the TA tried to explain every week. The slack channels  were filled with sycophants pandering to the TA while the students who needed help kept to themselves trying to salvage their semester. It almost seemed the course was being artificially loaded to ensure students dont give it an easy rating. I missed one assignment by submitting the wrong file (submitted a .pyc and it was fully my fault). However, there was no change of redemption for the rest of the semester and my grades were reflective of that one error.  Regret taking this class and didn't learn anything. The projects are all about tinkering with python to make some over-engineered scripts run. The scripts are modified to make grading easier and the piazza posts are filled with students unable to run the scripts or running into some random issues due to the script.  On the positive side though, OMSCS experience after this class has been much better - I guess rock bottom does have its plus points."

I learned a good bit and while I wouldn't necessarily use the information I gained in real-world scenarios, I enjoyed everything. I don't think the goal of a graduate course is to teach you tools to use on the job but rather more abstract topics. \n\nThe course consisted of two tests (82%, 75%) which were fair, but the 2nd test covered a rather large amount of research paper information that was difficult to digest. The projects were mostly fair and interesting with the exception of the 2nd project, which was more difficult than necessary and was an all or nothing shot. If you wrote 99% of the algorithm correct but had even one character off, the auto-grader fails you on everything and you essentially lose all points for the project. Because of this I went from an A to a B just because I didn't include a few else-if statements. The professor and TA's need to re-evaluate how they grade this project and aware partial credit. \n\nOutside of that, I would recommend the course as interesting and somewhat challenging."

It's optional, but I learned a lot more from it than the lectures, so if you don't have a networking background I highly recommend it.  For example, it presents TCP details very clearly and methodically, whereas the lectures assumed you were familiar already, so it was somewhat scattered.  I just rented it on Amazon for the semester for $30 - well worth it.\n\n**Projects**:  For the summer term, we only had 5 projects.  Typical semesters have 7 I think.  If you know Python and read the directions, they were pretty simple.  The longest one took maybe 5 hours.\n1. Network topology simulation\n2. Spanning tree protocol\n3. Buffer bloat experiment\n4. SDN firewall implementation\n5. BGP hijack attack\n\n**Tests**: Two tests, a midterm and a final.  Final isn't comprehensive, but covers a lot more material.  All questions were true/false or multiple choice.  The midterm was pretty easy, but the final was tougher (probably because I didn't study as hard for it though).  Definitely review the study questions and answers carefully, as they cover nearly everything on the test.  \n\n**Papers**:  19 papers total, most were reasonably dry but decently interesting.  A few were excellent:\n1. End to end argument\n2. Internet architecture and principles\n3. Bulletproof networks\n4. How secure are interdomain routing protocols\n5. Crossfire attack - this one sounds pretty scary.",

I watched lectures from Stanford Lagunita's Computer Networking before taking this class, and it gave me a broad overview.  The lectures were descent, but professor's handwriting was a professor's handwriting.  This class presents Computer Networks at a higher level than packets, layers, etc.  More about data centers, bgp, big networks. \n\n**Projects 1-2-3** Used mininet and python to complete some different tasks.  Each project was progressively more difficult, but nothing too overwhelming.  Project 3 was probably the most difficult assignment in the course.\n\n**Projects 4-5** These were more like lab experiments.  Trying some different things, making observations.  Reports were the deliverable.\n\n**Project 6** - Software Defined Networking.  Got to program a switch, using Python, to create a firewall.  Straightforward.\n\n**Project 7** - BGP Hijack - Very cool project, maybe the second most difficult to project 3.  \n\n**Overall** I really enjoyed this class.  Projects were fair.  I never spent more than an average of 10 hours per week, though sometimes I would get into a project and work at it like crazy and get it done, then have a week to catch up on videos and reading.  The exams were a bit challenging, but not impossible.  Easy A if you do the work.  TA's are very engaged and helpful.  Project documents are very organized.",

The last portion of the course goes into a few weaknesses that malicious parties use to mount a variety of attacks.\n\nThere were 5 projects, all python, nothing particularly difficult but very much helped to reinforce the topics we were studying at the time. The two tests were through ProctorTrack and tested your knowledge of some of the finer details covered (I was not a fan of the tests).\n\nOverall, I loved the class! I learned a lot about how and why the internet works the way it does today and would recommend it to anyone! It is a great first course or could be paired easily with more difficult classes.",

The videos are in terrible shape. They are unclear, and the voice of instructor is very unappealing and blank. 2 mins into the video is enough to put me into sleep.

                        "body": "Computer Networks was the first course I took as part of OMSCS since I've read here about its reputation of being one of the easier courses, but also because I worked on network protocols at the time as a software engineer. As a SE you don't really have the larger picture, I knew very well how the data plane works and how you would program one, but I only had a superficial understanding of the protocols that ran on top (only learned enough to debug whatever I was working on) and BGP was a complete mystery to me.\n\nDespite the course being easy I learned a lot and I really enjoyed the course! To get the most out of it I would strongly recommend reading all the papers in detail, and not just scanning them to make sure you know enough for the exam. I found the paper selection to be by far the most valuable part of the course. They were all high quality papers and they all covered very interesting topics:\n- general Internet architectural principles (some of the best papers I have ever read and I work as an academic researcher now having left my SE job so I read plenty of those)\n- BGP overview - BGP is the most important protocol on the Internet so it's worth paying attention\n- some TCP, queuing, and congestion control - I found these less exciting, but they were all good papers\n- SDN - SDN is a hot topic in research and industry right now and there is very little in terms of educational material so it's really worthwhile to get as much out of this part of the course as you can\n- data center architecture - a fascinating topic for networking due to how different it is from a normal network\n- network security - it's terrifying to see how easy it is to subvert the flow of Internet traffic\n\nI found most of the projects very interesting as well, though I didn't like the report based ones which were pretty boring. A lot of people say projects 2 and 3 are really hard. They are if you don't think about your code as you write it. The amount of code you write is extremely small so it's worth thinking through every line that you write. If you carefully account for all edge cases, your code will breeze through all the test cases. As others have said - pay attention to Piazza and pick up all the different test cases people publish. The remaining projects are pretty easy. There is an extra credit component for project 7 that can give you an extra 5%, but it is fairly challenging (though that may depend how advanced you want your solution to be).\n\nA lot of people often complain that some of the projects don't follow from the lectures which is a complaint I find incredibly frustrating. The projects are designed to teach you material that isn't as easily presented in a lecture format. This makes the projects much more interesting as well.\n\nOverall I would strongly recommend this course!\n\nPros:\n- interesting material\n- good selection of papers\n- the course is easy so you will have time to focus on the material\n- interesting projects\n\nCons:\n- the write up based projects were pretty dull (but they were easy marks)",

Transitioned from Software Test Engineer to more Software Development during this phase of taking this course, full time job. Knowing a bit of Python helped a little on some of the homework.\nCourses taken so far were:\n- IOS Spring2018\n- SAD Summer2018\n- SAT & SDP Fall2018\n\nClasses taken concurrently with this class:\nCN & DB\n\nI would say by now I have gotten the hang of the program and how it works, so I knew my abilities and what I needed to do.\n\n\n<b>Summary</b>\n\nI had basically no prior networking experience, except doing TCP from GIOS. Decent class for introducing networking concepts but I could not utilize it to my potential because I had 2 other classes to worry about so I couldn't fully grasp all the concepts. Lectures used a lot networking vocabulary that as a beginner, made it hard for me to understand esactly what was going on and what everything meant... Did bad on 2 of the exams, and slightly above average on 1 exam (73%, 65%, 52%), all full score on homework except 1 assignment which I got like 75% on, able to limp away with a B in this class.\n\n<b>Pros</b>\n- Homework was all Python, well guided\n- Lectures decent, but can be difficult for beginner\n- Subject supposedly very important/fundamental for software engineers\n\n<b>Cons</b>\n- 2nd and 3rd homework assignments can be pretty difficult\n- Can be confusing for someone that has had no networking experience\n\n<b>Tips</b>\n- Make sure to do enough testing on your homework assignments to make sure they are correct. I got burned by not taking into account one edge case (literally like 1 incorrect comparison) and costed me 25% of the assignment, which can be a huge impact to your grade.\n- If you spend time to really read papers and study concepts, you might get more of it than me because I only had so much time dedicated to this class (juggling 2 other classes with full time job)",

More or less you run an experiment setup from a paper and write a report. Some people may enjoy that though. You mostly learn an academic understanding of networks not many tools you could apply to a job. I think that is reasonable though as this is a grad program. I am neutral on it.

                        "body": "Overall, a decent class. As someone with no background in Computer Networks, I found this course to be a decent introduction to it. The projects were overall not too difficult and were all in python. My preferred language of choice is Java, but I didn't find the python code for this class to be too demanding. I think the first two programming projects were considered the toughest and worth the most. One was the Spanning Tree Protocol and the other was Distance Vector Routing. If you're stuck, make sure to attend office hours and check out the TAs' introductions/explanations. They were pretty helpful. TA's were also pretty responsive so that was pretty great. Some other reviewers already posted detailed info on each project, so I won't really repeat it. The professor was non-existent and we only _heard_ about her through the TA's. She chimed in through the TA's to remediate some problems with due dates at the beginning of the semester, and that was it.\n\nThere were a lot of research paper assignments, and frankly, the readings were quite dry, apart from maybe a few. I can tell you I won't miss those. Fortunately, it wasn't _entirely_ necessary to read them _too closely_ since the TA's actually put together amazing study questions for each test. The answer key to the study materials summarize the main points to each paper pretty well.\n\nThe lectures do feel like they need a refresher since the professor who made them is no longer there. Plus, it kinda feels like the lectures do a lazy job explaining a lot of the concepts. I won't miss watching them...\n\nThe tests were straightforward. I fully admit that I'm not a fan of memorization type tests, which is what this class did. It was a lot of trying to determine between two answer choices with some minor differences in description, so it was either you remembered the exact wording or you don't. I always did _eh_ on these. Got mostly high-70's on the test, but I was still able to get >90% in my overall grade since I did well on the projects. \n\nAlso, they gave out 6% extra credit. You can earn up to 5% from trying some EC portion in the last project (Project #7), and 1% from participating in 3 discussion thread through the semester (that's 1% from participating in 3 discussions in total---**not** 1% for each participation!)",

Most projects had you programming in python on top of a framework called mininet, though some had you do analysis without coding.  A couple of the projects required an elementry understanding of shell scripting,\n\nThe projects were fair, though not fun or interesting.  More than once I lost hours either due to grammatical mistakes in the instructions or inconsistencies in the supplied code that requires you to go through the code with a fine toothed comb, most likely caused by the project being built on top of a demo for one of the frameworks.  I didn't find the projects useful as I did not learn much of anything doing them, rather they have you demonstrating or confirming aspects from the lectures or papers.\n\nProjects also felt disconnected from the original course vision.  The first project is stated to make you comfortable using mininet.  However the knowledge and skills gained from this project are not really used in the future projects.  I did not feel like that first project was useful to me.\n\nProjects felt designed to be pass/fail.  There was no \"gotchas\" in the grading, hidden test cases, or testing for extreme edge cases.  If you followed the instructions and confirmed your code did what the instructions wanted you to do you'd get a 100 on the project.\n\nExams were mostly fair.  I did have a couple issues with questions on the exam that boiled to \"X is a type of _____.\"  Where the answer to this question was one offhand sentence in a lecture.  The other issue I had was I had a hard time with some of the true/false questions as they could feel like trick questions, things like giving the right description of an algorithm but not sure about one of the adjectives in the description.  This felt unfair when you have the knowledge to describe the algorithm, what it does, how it does it, and what it's weakness is, but cannot recall the specific wording used in the course.\n\nIn the end there is good knowledge to have here.  If you can average a high C in the exams (easily doable) and got full marks on all your projects, you'll walk out with a good amount of knowledge gained and an A.",

The TA weekly office hours (Thursdays at 10 pm eastern) are very helpful especially at the beginning of the semester. The TAs also host several weekly chat at different hours through out the day. They are very responsive on piazza. So there is plenty of help available.\n\nI found the projects to be quite straight forward but at the same time a good learning experience. The amount of coding required is very little and it's all in basic Python. If you know how to create functions, loops, sets, lists, tuples, and dictionaries in python 2.7 - you are all set coding wise. I recall one of the past reviewers mentioned that this class taught them how the internet works. I found that assessment to be very true. \n\nThe exams were multiple choice/multiple answer or true/false and mostly based on remembering the high level details from the class lectures. There are ~20 research papers to read through out the semester and they are also part of the exam. \n\nTo get an \"A\", you need to make sure that you score 100% on the 7 projects and try to get the 6% extra credit that is available. This puts you at 76% and then you will only need to score 50% on exams to make an A.\n\nThis class is in need of a refresh. The professor who created the lecture videos is no longer at Georgia Tech, so I felt a disconnect between the projects and the lectures. There should be more than one SDN project using Pyretic API/OpenFlow and Mininet as well as lectures and projects on cloud networking concepts. I also wish that the class had bonnie (auto-grader) for project 2, 3, and 6.\n\nOverall, I liked this class and I would highly recommend this as a first course. Additionally if you are very new to Python, this class will provide a very gentle introduction.",

Assignment 3: Distance Vector Routing. Python coding - TA explained the full algorithm in office hours - just need to implement it. (~5 hours)\n4. Assignment 4: TCP Fast Open. Mininet experiment based on a research paper. All instructions are given in the project write up, you just need to run commands in mininet, analyze the results, and write a report. (~8 hours including paper reading)\n5. Assignment 5: Congestion Control & Buffer Bloat. Mininet experiment based on research paper. All instructions are given in the project write up, you just need to run commands in mininet, analyze the results, and write a report.  (~8 hours including paper reading)\n6. Assignment 6: SDN Firewall - implement a firewall using pyretic - very little programming involved (probably under 30 lines). Use the test suite provided by the TAs on Piazza to verify. (~5-7 hours)\n7. Assignment 7 + Extra Credit: BGP Hijacking - run a topology through bgp prefix hijacking. Very little programming (~10 lines), requires creating a diagram and changing 12 configuration files. \n\n<b>General</b>\n* The instructor is absent but the TAs are great!\n* Basic python coding is needed. Even if you don't know python you will be able to figure out the assignments - the coding required is very basic. \n* Assignments are due almost every other week so if you finish the assignment when it's released you'll have at least 1 week free!\n* No prep work needed before the class. Many posts mention going through the Stanford networking course videos but this is really unnecessary. All the material you need for the assignments and exams is covered in the class. Don't waste your time with prepping before the class. \n* Exams require watching lecture videos & reading papers - 3 exams, multiple choice questions. Usually just a weekend worth of studying needed before the exam. You have 1 week to take the test. Closed notes. Don't read the full research paper for the exams - just get a high level understanding of the concepts. No questions related to experiment setup or related work for the papers. \n* Piazza is well structured and TAs are very responsive and helpful. \n* Assignment instructions are very detailed and useful and include all information needed to complete the assignment. \n* 80 points of Extra Credit available - 3 10 point discussion thread and one 50 point project with Assignment 7. \n* Lots of tests for coding related assignments are provided by other students and TAs."

Hopefully she's just shy and works diligently behind the scenes OR she gives her pay to the (good) TAs. A few of the TA's were great -- they encourage and give you reassurance without giving you the answer. Others couldn't relate the ideas and/or didn't do their homework. A lot of papers to read, some were technical and required a lot of research. The videos are hastily made and in need of care. I worked much longer than most people, at least longer than they say they do. This includes extra time studying, testing projects, reviewing Piazza and Slack, and researching. You can get by with less, especially if you have some background in networking applications. A couple of the projects, particularly 2, 3, 6, and 7, took some time to figure out. A bit challenging, but you are set up to succeed. I enjoyed the course and would recommend it. It's not overly challenging, but you can get more out by putting more into it.",

I don't think any project took more than a day (5- 8 hours), and no accompanying reports were required for the coding projects.  A good intro class and mostly interesting.  Had a high enough grade going into the final that I didn't really study or read the last set of papers (and still did fine).",

I had a pretty extensive background in networking prior to this exam having worked as a penetration tester and as a system administrator, but I wanted a bit more theory to balance out my practical experience. The course content was not very deep, but it did cover a lot concepts like buffer bloat, a few routing algorithm implementations, and some SDN that I felt was useful. There was the opportunity to get some extra credit in case you really messed up a project. I personally found the exams to be really hit or miss, and I consistently scored below average. I felt the questions were difficult to parse sometimes, and missing more than a few guaranteed a B or C on the exam (I believe this is accurate). I would STRONGLY recommend getting Project 2 and 3 to pass ALL TESTS. In Project 3 I placed a ``break``` in the wrong spot and ended up only passing 8/9 tests. I thought I would do alright on this project, but ended up with a 40/150. This severely constrained my ability to earn an A, so I strongly recommend getting ALL TESTS to pass. Sounds obvious, right? Like all CS classes, you are better off knocking out all homework/projects as SOON as they are assigned. Failing to do this means you will not have the time to be able to ask the TAs for help. Nothing but my own fault for not doing this.",

Project 2 and 3 are the hardest and I finished them in one weekend day. The amount of extra credit given was ridiculous.. really easy A because of these opportunities. The exams were annoying.

Those were most helpful for studying.\n\n**Readings** Research papers were interesting. Liked it when TAs posted questions to guide the reading or projects.\n\n**Projects** 7 projects/labs. Most of the grade so do well on them. You can't work ahead. Project specifications are clear. Lots of unnecessary, repeated questions about projects on Piazza. Read the project docs closely and watch any project videos the TAs share. These go a long way to help you understand what you have to do. I liked the 2nd and 3rd projects on writing distributed network algorithms; they were the most interesting projects with Python coding. The last three projects required more configuration and less coding.\n\n**Homework** None\n\n**Instruction** While the lecture videos are clear, the diagrams and text on the screen is generally messy. Could be better. TAs were helpful on Piazza. The professor was largely absent until midway through the course when the head TA (Stacia) was let go. Stacia was great, and the TAs always responded quickly. I didn't experience VM problems but some students did.\n\n**Pre-reqs** None. Some introductory material on networks, TCP handshake, and Python coding will help.\n\n**Overall** I had little to no networking knowledge prior to this course so I learned a lot. I didn't find the content super interesting, but it is useful. Good to know more about TCP/IP, distributed networking algorithms, congestion, traffic engineering, and software defined networking. It's a good choice of a first course in the program. It was my 7th.",

Lectures are very superficial and I did not get any real knowledge about networks after completing this course. Also it is annoying that the lectures are not current/relevant with missing portions making it look like you're watching a poorly edited movie.\n\nEarlier projects were a little bit interesting, like implementing distributed networking algorithms. TAs were supportive, but did not really encourage creativity. I noticed that some of my fellow classmates got rude answers for questioning assignment structure or when they tried to come up with alternate ideas for implementing. It would have helped if the assignments gave more information about the algorithms we were trying to implement, because they were totally tangential to lecture material.\n\nAs others had noted, instructor was mostly absent, but she was the most helpful and the most respecting of students. She tried her best to clarify on doubts just before the exams and also helped us wade through tough papers.\n\nThis is a class to get good grades(IMO), you just have to scramble a bit every two weeks to submit a project and exams were mostly easy.\nRight now, it is not a good class to learn about networking, but if the lectures and assignments are revamped(as the instructor kept promising), this course has potential to become a better one.",

For the tests, study the lectures and papers in the week they were assigned, don't wait to the end or you won't be able to finish study on time.\n\nOverall I loved the course, but I don't consider it an easy course (to pair with a harder course for example), however this is my first course and I don't have anything to compare with.",

You will enjoy the class and if you are comfortable with python and know basics about networking you will learn new things and it will be an easy class for you. Tests are easy too. The overall structure of the class is very well laid out though some projects may require you to spend a weekend (20-30hrs) to make sure you get full grade for them. Since most projects are autograded, if you do well on them the class should bag you an easy B and little more effort should get you a very comfortable A.\n\nNow this semester the class had to go through some issues. Stacia Stokes (the head TA) was let go in the middle of the semester and it seemed like she was pretty much ticking all the right boxes as a head TA so nobody understood what happened. After that the class went a little numb for a while. Projects 2-3 had videos to help students complete the projects made by stacia which were super helpful but once she was let go, the videos for later projects made by some other TA were terrible. They were not clear and it may not be the TAs fault probably the course just had management issues so nobody knew what was going on. So the class definitely ran into problems mid semester.\n\nOnce that happened in order to literally make up for they threw an additional 7% extra grade points. You literally had to do nothing but give feedback on the class VM to get 6% of the 7%. This meant almost everyone would get an A or a B since the official class already had a 5% extra graded portion for the last project. So 12% extra grade was just ridiculous and made the class too easy to get an A. The 7% will most likely not be there next semester cause it felt like a lame attempt to convince students not to badly rate the class anyway.\n\nAll in all I would probably still suggest this class if you want to learn some interesting stuff about Computer Networks. The class may not be helpful for anything real world since it just briefly teaches all the concepts and doesn't go deep into something but it should be an easy class for a semester if you dont want too much work load. Easy B. Little more effort and comfortable A.",

Head TA, since removed in Fall 2018 I believe, I found to be a challenging personality. Some programming experience for a few of the projects will be extremely helpful. Most of the projects are done inside of a virtual machine, which generally worked well enough. Albeit it's a network simulator that could sometimes be flakey producing inconsistent results.",

Most of content was really interesting, but the grading was pretty strict, the professor was nowhere to be seen, and the TAs weren't very helpful. There are 7 projects and 3 tests total in this class. The tests aren't bad as long as you study. Projects 2 and 3 were a bit tricky because they were easy to mess up on, but once you get past them the rest of the class is smooth sailing. As others have mentioned, halfway through the semester our head TA was randomly fired and the other TAs had to scramble to fill her spot. Honestly, I was a bit happy the head TA was gone because she was a bit mean and abrasive. For example, a lot of students had issues with the provided VM we were supposed to use for Project 1 (the file system kept randomly locking). Instead of being helpful and trying to resolve the issue, the head TA blamed us for the issue and refused to take us seriously when dozens of us posted on Piazza about our issues solely because they weren't able to replicate the issue on their machine. I had a friend (very competent person who would have done well in this course) drop solely because of the VM issues during the first project and how unhelpful the TAs were. The course became so ridiculous with the TA drama that the professor stepped in (who hadn't been seen in months) and showered us with extra credit assignments, which I didn't mind. Overall this was a class with interesting content, but I don't think I'd recommend it (especially not as a first course).",

If I didn't know Python, this would have been much more difficult for me. The projects are basically due every 2 weeks, all the test material is given at the beginning of the semester; the only thing you can't work ahead on is the projects. The TAs are extremely responsive and attentive, which is a huge advantage as the professor is non-existent. Stacia was the head TA for the first half of the course, and like others said, she runs a tight ship and doesn't take attitude from anyone (and seems to be overworked), but that worked with my personality style so I had no issues. Halfway through, she was replaced and the other TAs had to scramble to cover the workload Stacia previously covered. The other TAs did a great job carrying the course to completion and worked extremely hard. Most of the topics are interesting, the projects are really captivating IMO, but the readings are pretty boring. Overall, good class and wonderful TAs -- the class would have been a disaster without them.",

The class refers a free online [Stanford course](https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/Engineering/Networking/Winter2014/about) that fits the bill, but best not to wait until the semester is underway to do so. \n\nMany research papers to read. TAs were helpful and responsive (one in particular), and overall this was a very well-run course. Only drawback was that the professor was almost entirely absent, with somewhat dated lectures coming from a professor who has been at another university for a few years now.",

The material is very boring although some of the security stuff toward the end of the class was a little more interesting we didn't do much with it though.  The lectures are quite boring and I just tried to get through them as quickly as possible.  Tests were proctored and not to bad to study for.  There was a mid term and final. \n\nThere were 5 project in this summer session.  The first was using mininet and topology design.  The second was more topology design, switches, routers, etc.. and required some basic python programming.  The third was more of an experiment, run the tests and write about what you found.   The fourth was about firewalls and required basic python.  The fifth was about bgp and utilized mininet again.  For the projects its important to note that the way you submit them to canvas was different for every project.  Which I thought was very odd and cost you 15 points if you submitted it incorrectly.  They said it was because of the grading scripts.  I don't know if that is supposed to be a gotcha or just poor design.  Sometimes the file format you were supposed to submit were listed in a random piazza post by a student who had to ask about the format of the file submission.  Just pay close attention to that and make sure you ask if its not clear in the directions.  \n\nThere was 80 points of extra credit as well.  \n\nTA's were active on piazza and tried to answer questions there.  I don't recall the instructor ever really interacting other than at the very last week.   \n\nIf I could go back to the beginning of the summer I would have chosen a different class.  I don't recommend it unless you're gung-ho on comp networking.",

Test 1 I thought was fairly good and required application of concepts we learned, think Test 2 missed the mark. Neither of them required more than 5 hours of studying. \n\nThe TAs were alright and the head TA definitely ran a tight ship for better or worse.

A nice variety of papers to read, and I found the lectures to be well designed / delivered, and quite cogent and lively. The tests were all single-answer / multiple-choice, and relatively straightforward, if you had boned up on the material. The projects were also quite manageable, given sufficient time; 2 and 3 were among the most challenging, but it's pretty smooth sailing after that front-loaded difficulty.\n\nIn the Spring 2018 iteration, the current Professor (Maria Konte) was more or less MIA until the latter third of the course, and even then they only made occasional, brief appearances. However, she was a very positive, clarifying presence whenever she did weigh in.\n\nThere were a number of TA's who were friendly and helpful, but from whom we heard little. A lot of that appeared to be due to the fact that the lead TA (Stacia Stokes) seemed not to be a big fan of delegation. Others have noted her propensity to run a tight ship, and that is true, but is not necessarily a positive if you don't like your grad school experience to be akin to being the lowest ranking seaman in the Navy. She publicly castigated / punished students she apparently considered to be overly creative / curious, or insufficiently enamored of her top-down approach, on a number of occasions (as she seems to conflate them with the lazy or unmotivated as being \"problem students\".) Left something of a bad taste in my mouth, but she did competently bring the enterprise to its prescribed destination, I suppose, so... \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af Caveat discipuler.",

A little too easy.\n\nThe best part of this course was the interesting papers that we were assigned to read each week.\n\nLectures were okay. They covered a lot of ground, which was nice but often did so in a superficial manner. Exams also covered a lot of ground, but superficially.\n\nFor the most part, the assignments were poorly put together and most of the \"challenge\" in them was working around the parts that were broken or poorly specified. There was one exception. Project 2 was actually pretty interesting, and a reasonable challenge. I got my hopes up after it, thinking that it was representative of what was to come, but sadly, the assignment quality went down from there.\n\nThe professor left the TAs to fend for themselves for the most part. I think she posted in Piazza a handful of times the entire semester. From what I could tell, the TAs did the best they could, given the professor's absence.",

I took this class first because I don't have a lot of computer science courses under my belt, this is a foundational course I think any good software developer should take, the reviews indicated this is a relatively low workload course (compared to, e.g., Machine Learning and the like), and I am good with Python (and this class uses Python).\n\nFirst, the good points. I feel like I learned a lot about principles of system design and why the Internet is designed the way it is. The projects were a good mix of \"implement this algorithm\", \"configure a virtual network\", and \"reproduce and analyze the results from this academic paper\". The last item, reproducing and analyzing an academic paper, was particularly nice because it exposed me to how computer science research is actually done, experience that I did not have. That said, reading the papers and writing the report did eat up a lot of time, especially compared to the actual programming portions of the projects (I am an experienced Python programmer, so this part was a breeze). None of the projects were group projects, so that is also a huge plus. The lectures were mostly engaging, with enthusiastic presenters.\n\nNow, some negatives. The tests were usually not well designed. There were three, and only the first seemed to do a good job asking interesting questions that required advanced thinking about the concepts; the other two were filled mostly with what seemed like arbitrary tidbits from the readings and lectures, and were sometimes ambiguously worded. Also, some of the projects' instructions were not clear and the TAs sometimes did a poor job with clarifications, resulting in more anxiety and confusion about the projects than should have been there. Lastly, the professor made approximately two appearances all semester, one of those being during finals week to assign three entire papers to read and respond to for extra credit, taking the place of \"weekly discussions\" we were promised throughout the semester. This was poor form, and someone complained that this violated GA Tech policy of not assigning other work during finals week, so we all got extra credit without the need to participate in discussion or read the papers. Fine, but why not just do the discussions as indicated on the syllabus?\n\nOverall, I was happy with the course. It was a good first course for OMSCS, and I feel like the positives outweigh the negatives, so I would take it again. And, although I perhaps put in more hours than others with a more relevant background, I found the time commitment very manageable, given I have a full-time, minimal other commitments, and was taking only this class. Also, I read all of the assigned papers in full, which maybe bumped up my hours compared to other reviewers here. Just start projects as soon as possible, and you'll be OK.",

It requires just tons of memorization.\n\nTo get A, secure full score for projects (60 points). Get an extra credit (you can get 5 points by participating some discussion threads). And try to get 60%+ for exams. You even don't need to watch video lectures or read most of papers for the grade.\n\nPersonally I wish I could have more experience on SDN through projects (implementation).",

                        "body": "Background:\nThis is my first course in the OMSCS program and I intentionally took this course for two reasons.  First, I was interested in learning more about computer networks.  Next, from reviews on OMSCentral, this seemed to be on average one of the easier courses, so it provided a good stepping stone into the program.  I have an aerospace degree and have worked in the world of defense software for about 4 years now.\n\nPros:\n- The head TA (Stacia Stokes) is very attentive and present on Piazza.  Two thumbs up here.\n- Each project has enough time to complete.\n- The lectures, articles/readings, and projects do tie together for the most part.\n- You do learn a lot about both the historical and modern concepts of network programming.  They don't go too deep, but that's mainly because there is a lot of ground to cover.\n- Two instances of extra credit were offered (one for weekly discussions, another for an extra portion of the last project)\n\nCons:\n- The articles were difficult to read through.  Interesting topics, but the important points were buried in the article (typical techincal paper...).\n- The lecture videos can be a bit jumpy in its explanations, though it still holds to the overall lecture topic.\n- I had hoped to do a little more with software-defined networks (SDN's)\n- Projects 2 and 3 were intense (but if you get past those, you'll be fine.)\n- Test questions could sometimes be vague, and thus difficult to answer.\n- ProctorTrack may be more of a pain than it's worth.\n\nOverall I'm happy with this course.  I recommend it as a first course for anyone starting the program without a network background.  This course uses Python, so you'd benefit from already knowing it, but that's not a necessity.  Time spent each week really varied and depended on the project.  I probably spent time more than I needed to, so take that into account for the \"weekly workload\" stat."

As other reviewers have mentioned, the course requires Python programming knowledge; especially the second, third, and last two projects.\nThe three tests were all administered through Proctortrack and were very manageable if you studied the lectures and the required readings.\nThe head-TA (Stacia) was very responsive and definitely deserves recognition for how well she ran the course. The other TAs were quick to respond and grade the assignments/tests.\nOverall, CS6250 is a very good introductory course to advanced Computer Networks and to how OMSCS works. I'd highly recommend this course to anyone interested in the subject.",

Python programming is very limited. Most are the projects are less than 20 lines of codes, or just changing some variables/configuration in the given codes. \nTA in this course is nothing but great. Projects are returned in timely manners. Head TA is very active on Piazza and there is weekly office hour in helping students on projects.  \nProject 2 and 3 can be tricky, but after that, the course has a very light workload.

The professor (Konte) was around for a couple of Piazza posts, answered a few questions about the exams, did two very awkward office hours, and that was about it. The head TA, Stacia, ran this course like a tight ship and really made it worthwhile. The other TAs were helpful and responsive as well. Communication was frequent and regular.  I found the content itself interesting, having familiarity only with the basics of TCP and a high-level understanding of internet architecture. I think I would have been fine without any prior knowledge of computer networks. The first few projects are designed like coding challenges in Python. They were challenging and I really enjoyed them, but they seemed to be a headache for people not familiar with Python or OO programming who took to Piazza to vent regularly.  The later projects were less time intensive and more about performing a set of trivial tasks and then analyzing the results against what was presented in the class. Some people got lost in the trees on these, more Piazza venting. I think I was lucky this semester in that there were a few very helpful and responsive students in the class who offered guidance on a lot of the class topics by their ability to summarize and explain the material on Piazza.",

Worked in power distribution since then. Never programmed in Python before.\n\n\nCourse Experience: I rated this course a \"Loved!\" as an incredibly helpful introduction to computer networks. You will use the basics of python for the assignments that are not exceedingly difficult. I simply had to transfer basic coding techniques from C and Java into Python syntax. This class introduces a broad and limited understanding of computer networks topics. This is not a course that will teach you about writing code for significant network applications with SDNs or otherwise. The instructor was largely absent which made for some easy extra credit discussions. The TAs were very helpful and effective and made the course successful. Only one assignment out of eight had a significant issue that didn't effect grades for anyone. Exams were simple memorization of concepts from the lectures and papers. I earned an A in this course even without the extra credit so I'm confident the vast majority of students would be able to given enough time to figure out the harder projects. Great first course or easier course to pair with a harder one.",

Some fairly complicated networking topics are not explained with an appropriate level of detail. If you don't have the background on standard routing and switching technologies you'll likely need to do supplemental research to handle the first two projects. \n\nThe tests cover a lot of material and the questions are fairly subjective overall. It can be tough to know what the \"best\" answer is. Still, they aren't unfair and if you complete the test preparation questions you should be fine.\n\nSome reviews have characterized this course as \"Network Programming in Python\". This is hardly accurate. The course clearly lists at least an introductory level in Python is required. The first two projects are probably the hardest of the semester, but both can be completed with around 50 lines of code. The real challenge is in understanding the algorithm. The code itself requires nothing more than the ability to use variables, follow control logic, and pass messages, all capabilities learned in any introductory computer science course. The undergraduate networking course required implementations in C, and those projects were much more time-consuming then anything found here.\n\nOverall, I recommend the course to anyone interested in Computer Networks as an operational discipline. If you just want to know how to write networking code as an applications developer, this course isn't for you.",

My favorite parts were learning about the original design principles of the internet (since it was a department of defense project), and how TCP flows and congestion control work. I used to do a lot more backend work, and this class has given me some better background info on some of the projects I was working on. \n\nThe projects are a split between programming interview / competition style Python algorithms, and lab reports based on experiments conducted using a simulated network. The 2nd and 3rd projects are hard especially if you haven't had much programming experience. The lab report assignments can be very time consuming, since there's a lot of graphs to embed into google docs documents and explanations to give. The tests are moderatly difficult to hard, so make sure you study. The later readings really pile up, and can be fairly dense and dry. The lectures are great overall, but can be a little unclear in explanations. The professor has also been mostly absent during the course, and has only given us one or two office hour videos. Luckily, the best parts of the course have been the amazing student resources. The Brainscape flash cards, the test prep notes, and the great questions have really made the class a lot better. Our TA (Stacy Stokes) has done a really great job in posting weekly office hours answering questions to help explain projects. Piazza can be hit or miss, since there's a TON of threads, and it's hard to find important imformation even when threads are pinned. \n\nSummary: Recommended. If you're a solid programmer, this is a good first course to take."

Others, though, have a number of issues ranging from poor descriptions, poorly written and formatted provided code, and just being a huge waste of time. Grading for the homework is sometimes nonsensical as well. Some of the lectures are good, others are insufficient to explain the material with the level of detail appropriate for a course at this level. Exams are difficult and not conducive to real learning.

The assignments are hard (the first assignment was an exception, rest were very hard). I had taken because of the ratings here and now I know not to trust just the ratings here. For anyone who is planning on taking this, please strengthen your basics on Computer Networks, and for sure make sure that you are very comfortable with algorithms and coding, because that is what you are going to need the most. The lecture videos are poorly structured and defined. For most of the topics, you will have to spend quite some time doing research on your own, which is still manageable. Overall, beware of the assignments; you are going to need to spend way more time on those.",

If you got the projects done during the first week, the second week was mostly just lectures/reading. \n\nThere is a ton of reading in this class. It can get a bit dry and daunting, especially since each week there are a handful of papers to read, each being ~13-15 pages in length. On top of that, some projects have a surprise paper that must be read to complete it. On top of this, even though some papers are split into the second week of the project, they are helpful to read if completing the project during the first week. This also applies to the video lectures. \n\nFor the summer semester, there were 5 projects and 2 tests. Project 1-3 were pretty simple, Project 2 taking the most time. Projects 4-5 were a bit more open ended and validating your work could sometimes be difficult. \n\nBecause it was the summer, they squished the latter half of the content into a single exam worth 30% of your grade. In my opinion, this was too heavily weighted, with each incorrect answer reducing your final grade by over 1% (as there were only 26 questions on this exam. )\n\nThe TAs were responsive and helpful, but the instructor was completely absent. She appeared once to ask \"why we were interested in the course. \" She was supposed to post weekly discussion threads to provoke thoughtful discussion, but this never happened. These discussion threads were to apply to a 5% extra credit score, which ended up being applied to everyone's grade since no threads were ever posted. \n\nOverall, I liked the class and I learned a lot, but it has flaws which I hope are resolved in the coming semesters.",

The course material itself is interesting - If you don't know in detail how internet works and nothing about traffic engineering, security issues, what is a cluster etc this is a good course to learn. It assumes you know undergrad networking knowledge (which i do not have) so there is a bit of learning curve\n\n2. Second project is difficult - You need to know algorithm for this. I did not know and got 60/130\n\n3. Lectures - My goodness this is the most difficult part. Content isn't bad but delivery needs improving\n\n4. TAs- My class TAs were amazing. held the courses together and responded fast and with respect. Kudos to Kelly Parks (head TA) and other TAs with her. \n\n5. Professor - Promised discussions for extra credit but didn't deliver. Gave 5% boost to everyone at the end but you could have just said you were going to do that from the beginning. Not sure why you had to make everyone anxious until the last week of the class\n\n6. Exams - Only multiple choice. Not sure why it was formatted like this. It was helpful to get your grades fast but I would have appreciated bit more free form answer discussion. I guess the classes were too big? not sure\n\nOverall not a bad course if you want to learn about networking. I do wonder what the opportunity cost is though. You should think about whether you REALLY want to learn networking or not. If you think this is a blow off class like it used to be, it's not. Prepare to put in 10-15 hours of work"

The TAs were poorly organized and communication was extremely limited - there were so many unanswered, critical questions on Piazza. \n\nThe professor for the summer didn't even show up once. We were waiting for announcements that never came. The TA's favorite saying was, \"I'm still waiting to hear back from the professor\". \n\nThe test grading was absolutely ridiculous - the final was 30% of your grade and it was filled with multiple choice questions where the possible credit per question was 0, 0, 20, 60, or 100%. (5 multiple choice options, and any incorrect selections subtracted from your credit. This was true whether it was supposed to un/checked although the claimed purpose was to \"prevent people from clicking every option\" so not checking a box that was supposed to be checked still gets you marked off, which was stupid). So if you got 4/5 choices correct, you got 60% credit. 3/5 got you 20% credit. So stupid. \n\nThere are a TON of papers to read that have no relationship to the course except that the exams ask questions specific questions about them. \n\nI feel like too many people before said, \"This class is easy!\" so the professors/TAs decided to make things stupidly hard. I got an A on the final because I studied my ass off. I don't understand the need for rote memorization on things that don't matter, especially not for a meaningless exam that is 30%! of your grade, ESPECIALLY when there were questions that had absolutely nothing to the work we did in the course. \n\nI was very excited to take this course as it relates to personal interests, but this class was a huge disappointment. I had read reviews about the class being unorganized and I thought, \"Oh, they've got it figured out by now. \" No. They don't. Don't take this class.",

Do a few \"projects\", some of which require programming watered-down versions of standard algorithms, and some of which are just step-by-step tutorials on how to configure some network service (and write a report -- \"What did you see when you typed run. sh?\"). The ONE open-ended part of the class was to be weekly discussions on Piazza with the prof. These never happened. More on that below. \n\nIt was very poorly run. The prof (MK) never showed up after the first week. Not once. This might be OK in another class, but it meant that we didn't get any of the open-ended, research-oriented interaction promised in the syllabus. It also meant that the TAs floundered. They kept saying, \"I emailed the prof and I'll let you know what I hear. \" On the rare occasion the TAs were able to reach the prof, she made more false promises about when she'd show up. Prof hung the TAs out to dry, along with the entire class. The TAs made effort for the first half of the course, but by the end, most Piazza questions about the material went unanswered -- even the ones asking for guidance on errors in the test prep materials. \n\nThe exams were multiple choice and T/F with lots of ambiguity. In higher education, there's often some ambiguity, and you write about it and address it. In a multiple-choice exam, however, there is no opportunity to address the ambiguity! The tests are written using language that can be interpreted in multiple ways, and I never knew whether I was overthinking a sloppily-written question or if it was a trick question. Both types (sloppy and trick) are on the exam. I managed to do pretty well, but that was by careful deconstruction of the test author's psyche. Or guessing. \n\nRead the papers, watch the videos, and follow the tutorial projects like a monkey. You do need some skill turning basic algos into code, and luck on the exams.",

It explores some neat concepts on the cutting edge of Networking research though, so if you don't have a strong foundation in the fundamentals coming in you'll have to spend a lot of time catching up.

The programming portions of the course were fairly basic, even for a novice programmer such as myself. Brushing up on python syntax and data structures should be enough to complete the projects. \n\nBe prepared to spend a lot of time on Piazza asking questions and reading your classmates posts, as the instructions given in the lectures and projects may at times be vague or difficult to understand. The instructors generally do a very good job at responding to questions. \n\nThe tests vary in difficulty. I found the first test to be the easiest with the following test increasing in difficulty. The tests are provided in ProctorTrack and you are given a two hour window to complete them. However, all of them can easily be completed in under an hour. \n\nBetween the lectures, papers, and projects a lot of information is thrown at you. Some stuck and a lot did not, but I still learned a good deal. Overall, I would highly suggest this course if you are a new student. It is highly structured and requires little base knowledge, allowing you to ease into the OMSCS program. Just be prepared to do the work and allocate some time to study before the tests.",

Class was well run and the grade distribution for projects and test was done fairly.

Otherwise I would highly recommend this class. I learn't a lot and it was a good introduction to the program!",

To put my review in perspective, I'm from EE background with little to no knowledge about computer networks prior to taking this class. I took an introduction to Python course on coursera as preparation. \n\nThe course was very well structured and the TAs (Michael Brown was just amazing) ran the show in an organized and timely manner. Professor rarely dropped by but her absence was never felt thanks to the TAs. Participation from peers on Piazza was the best part of the course. I was never stuck during the course as students quickly shared and proposed fixes for the issues they encountered. \n\nThe lecture videos were superficial and only provided an introduction to the topics. I found the reading material (papers and articles) to be quite helpful in my learning. Most of the projects were interesting. First three and last two projects required some programming in Python and I didn't find the coding hard. The remaining three projects were spoon fed through instructions and their main goal was to analyze the results and write reports. Tests included short answer and multiple choice questions and I found the difficulty level to increase from test 1 to test 3. A thorough understanding of lectures and reading material was sufficient and needed to score full on the tests. \n\nI highly disliked the weekly discussion threads where extra credit was offered for participation. Most of the students including myself posted just for the sake of it and didn't contribute to learning."

The tests were made up of MCQ, true/false and some short answer (except the last test). Nothing seems to be set in stone so keep this in mind when preparing for the tests. Attending the office hours were very useful. The head TA at the time, Michael, really saved this class! The professor for the semester was really hands off. It appears she was mostly busy with other things and so we didn't get to see her much (she didn't hold weekly office hours). \n\nNote that the papers will take time to read and comprehend so if you're taking this class, try and get ahead of the readings.

                        "body": "I took this class my first semester in the program, alongside operating systems. I didn't technically meet the prerequisites, never having had a networking class in my undergrad curriculum, but I wanted to use my first semester to maybe try to get some of the more fundamental topics squared away. \n\nI learned a fair bit about how the internet worked, and the introduction to software defined networking was fun to play around in. But I could feel that the class was kind of in an awkward state right now, perhaps transitioning somewhat from a heaver focus on SDN when the course was first designed. Lectures referred to projects that were no longer part of the course, for example, and I'd say only the last two of the eight projects really involved playing around with SDN. \n\nThe remainder of the projects concerned fundamentals (e. g. graph search over a topology) or were follow-along demonstrations of topics we read about in journal articles. These latter projects really required no coding -- you'd just follow the instructions provided and write up the results. \n\nSome of the projects were newly designed and had bugs, but those were worked out and time extensions were given where necessary. If they keep the same project structure I don't expect that to be a problem in later semesters. \n\nA couple other reviews say the tests were hard. I didn't think so, really? I got As on the first two but a C on the final, so maybe they were adjusting the difficulty as they went along. Then again I didn't really study very hard for the final since I was focused on my other course... \n\nMy \"5 hours\" is a guess; I didn't keep track. Some weeks I barely did anything, but where there was a test or a particularly challenging project that might creep closer to 10 or 15. Rarely, though.",

I learned a lot, and enjoyed the class overall. \n\nThe tests were pretty rough though. I got a high A on every project, but struggled to make two C's and a B on the tests even when studying a lot. The tests felt a little bit luck-based -- did you happen to remember one sentence from one of the dozen research papers you read? If yes, it was easy. If not, then impossible to guess. I don't think the tests did a good job judging whether you'd learned the big picture or even the majority of individual topics discussed, rather they seemed mostly a sample of minutiae from the papers which you may or may not remember. \n\nOne big warning, I think they've revamped this course in the last semester or two, because it was fairly challenging (especially the tests) and took a decent amount of time each week. There's some kind of project or test almost every single week, so you really don't get much of a break. \n\nPast reviews indicated this class was easy. I don't think that's true anymore. I'd say this class is relatively *tractable* in the sense that if you can put in the time to memorize all the papers you read, and put in enough time on the individual projects, you have a very good chance of earning an A.

This course definitely covered a lot of areas of networks, at times almost too many topics. I also felt the Udacity lectures covered so much so fast. I often had to repeat each \"lesson\" 2-3 times to really capture and/or understand some of the concepts. \n\nThe tests (only 3 of them) were a little more difficult than I thought, but were fair and covered the material well. A lot of the test covered the outside readings and/or projects... definitely testing your understanding of the subject matter instead of just the facts of it. \n\nThere were a lot of projects (8+) in this course, and usually before you finished one, the next one was already out and time ticking on it. One or two of the projects were problematic (computer/VM wise) and were stressful to accomplish. I didn't mind putting in time to learn the material, but fighting with the tools was not productive time spent. I had a few commitments at work during this time which made it even more stressful. However, each of the projects were insightful and worthwhile, though a couple that evaluated certain protocol performance were not as exciting, but learned a great deal anyway. \n\nThe TAs (and Maria) were pretty responsive on Piazza, and held weekly office hours. \n\nFor me (after 25yrs) since BS degree, it was interesting to see how networking has changed and what was good then is being re-evaluated. Many of the concepts I've already put in motion on my company's projects and seeing some good results. Definitely a good class worth taking.",

More time will be required if you are rusty on your networking skills, as you'll need to read the textbook to catch up on basic concepts. On top of that there is a project every other week, which usually doesn't require much programming, and took me 3-5 hours on average. There are also 3 closed book tests which take a few hours to study for - easier if you have taken good notes. \n\nThis is a very good course to take. It should be called \"Advanced Computer Networking\", because like AOS, it covers modern research topics in computer networking. It is generally assumed you have a working knowledge of computer networks, and there will be little hand holding here. I learned a lot, even having professional experience. I highly recommend this course as a very practical course to take that will benefit any software engineer in their career. \n\nThe professor, M. Konte, is a internet security researcher, and the weekly office hours are a chance to pick her brain on stuff. She wasn't involved as much as I'd have liked on Piazza, though. The TAs though were very responsive on Piazza and slack - expect very quick turnarounds (< 12h) on questions asked. Tests and projects were generally graded within a couple weeks. So it's a very well run course overall. \n\nThe only negative is that a few of the projects had issues. This wasted me a lot of time on one project in particular, which was pretty annoying. I also would have liked to do more of the coding on the projects. Except for a couple exceptions, I feel like they hand-held a bit too much (mostly already implemented, you just run them and analyze the results).",

The subject is interesting and we covered a lot of computer networks material, from low-level routing and switching up to detecting rogue AS's. People who didn't know Python had a tougher time, so knowing it really helps. There were a number of papers to read (I liked them, some didn't). The instructor, Maria Konte, was new and stayed in the background until near the end, but TA team was great and the head TA Michael was a superstar so the class moved along like clockwork, with assignments coming back regularly and useful feedback. Some projects were a bit raw out of the gate - fortunately, the students on Piazza were very helpful in finding and fixing issues to keep things moving. Don't be fooled by the early reviews - it's not an easy class, it has morphed to be about medium difficulty and time - but it is predictable and well-tuned.",

On top of that I was accused of using pen and paper while taking the exam, and penalized, which I did not, and cant be seen on video either, while people using headphones were let by, quite unfair, never happened before on any tests.

TAs were really good, and the office hours were actually worth attending. \n\nI took this course alongside another class, so I may be off the mark, but this class was much more time consuming than it appears to be rated. Maybe they changed the content, or maybe I spent more time than normal, but I would have a hard time believing that 6 hours a week was enough for this course, since the lectures alone were at least an hour or two, and the papers were multiple pages, and released every week. \n\nYou need to know Python, but with the time frames you are given for projects (2 weeks), its a lot easier to learn in a course like this over say a course like Computational Photography",

It was more substantial than I expected and I would put it at a \"medium\" in terms of difficulty, now that I've finished. \n\nOverall, the assignments were great for understanding the concepts we covered in class, although I felt that some were not substantial or applicable enough. For example, there was one assignment, which was one of the more difficult assignments, that more so had to do with data structures rather than networking concepts themselves. \n\nExams were thorough and I felt that they sufficiently tested my knowledge, and the instructor and TA's were very responsive. Not sure if this will be the same for subsequent semesters, but I also appreciated the quick grading! Lastly, a working knowledge of Python will be useful for completing assignments.",

You will need to be familiar with Python and understand algorithms to an extent. For the Python skills you can take Udacity's Intro to Algorithms course which I had gone through only about a third of its material but it was enough for me to be able to successfully complete the projects that required a better Python understanding. There were 8 projects in total. The instructor was considerate that in some cases a student may have trouble reaching a solution, so for everyone assignment credit is explicitly given for turning something in that shows you had at least put forth some effort. \n\nThe exams were pretty challenging but the grading was fair. They were a mix of multiple choice and short answer. Multiple Answer Multiple Choice questions seem to be a theme throughout many of Georgia Tech's courses. Thankfully in this course they weren't all or nothing. Just be sure to only mark the ones you know or are pretty confident in and you'll likely reduce the damage. For test prep I would suggest focusing on understanding the topics covered in the study guides provided by the instructor. Then you can go over the test prep questions and solutions that were also provided. The professor was good about including the topics you should look over to be successful on the exams.",

No background knowledge of networking is needed. Make sure to give yourself enough time to watch the lectures and read the articles.

Some projects are more survey-like, basically running some commands and writing reports. You need to study the lectures and read papers as well. If you have programming experience, you should be fine to complete the projects. I find it interesting that some people claim they have no experience in python and find coding projects very hard. They probably have no programming experience as well but it does not change the fact that many projects are really not about the programming itself, all programming language uses in the course projects are basic. It is more about the course contexts rather than some language gimmicks. What I really like as well as other courses is that by studying the tests, I am forced to learn the concepts in depth, not just recognize the terms. You have to write essay answers in tests. Overall, it is a good course that covers most concepts of computer networking, especially in TCP/IP, network security.",

There was something due nearly every week, with projects of varying difficulty and with tests definitely requiring a good amount of time to study, as they included a lot of \"short essay\" questions, were timed, and proctored (via ProctorTrack). \n\nI found this class very enjoyable because it didn't include a lot of \"busy work\" - most everything we were asked to do led to learning something valuable. The projects were the best part. The tests were fair in that if you read all the material and did all the projects, you were pretty well prepared, but if you didn't understand something, it would become apparent on the short essay questions, of which there were many. \n\nI'd say the class is \"easy\" in that it does not require too much prior CS knowledge to succeed. You need to know a little bit of Python for most projects (but way less than KBAI or Computer Photography, for example), and you need to stay on top of things because there is a lot of material. But it is all doable and largely enjoyable. Definitely recommend.",

The quizzes are gone, but now the projects have a little bit more meat to them. The exams aren't terrible, but require you to actually do the reading (that's not a bad thing... ) and watch the lectures. \n\nMy only real complaint is it seems like some of the projects were in flight or being modified as we went. The last one was delayed due to issues for example and ended up being replaced. \n\nOverall I'd take this class. If you've had no exposure to Python (like me), it's a good way to get your feet wet. If you've had no programming experience at all? Some of the projects may be just a tad stressful.",

This was my first OMSCS course - I am an intermediate Python programmer at best, with a decent networking background and no real major programming background. This course was challenging without being too bad. Some weeks I spent 20-30 hours, some weeks less than 5. More of the former though. \n\nThere were 8 projects for 60% of your grade, which alternated between pretty challenging (coding wise) to more read/report which were interesting but easier. If you have a significant coding/Python background you have a big advantage, but otherwise they will push you. There is a lot of reading: academic papers, book, and background that took up a chunk of time I did not expect. \n\nThe course is a really good course, especially for a first one in OMSCS. Konte as a professor was great with feedback, Michael Brown as a head TA was great on that as well. The rest of the TAs, Michael, and Maria Konte were simply fantastic overall. Incredibly responsive on Piazza. \n\nThe tests are 40% of your grade. Although Test 1 was pretty random and not super representative of the material, Test 2 and Test 3 were much better - challenging but very fair. Just do not think you are walking into an easy A. \n\nOverall the course was great! I learned a lot, and feel like a stronger Python programmer.",

                        "body": "My Background: CS Undergrad, 3+ years industry experience in Software Development, No Networking undergraduate class. \n\nProjects 60%. Each project is very easy if you have decent programming experience in Python or a similar language. To be honest, I felt like they were too easy (though I did learn something from most of them). Be sure to do well on the projects so that you have some room to not do so well on the tests. \n\nTests 40% I studied 20+ hours for both tests, but much of that was catching up on lectures I had fallen behind on. Before the curve, I got B's on the tests (A's after the adjustment). From what I understand, the Spring 2016 offering was the first to incorporate 2 tests whereas previous semester had quizzes. Be warned, from what I can tell, these tests are much harder than those quizzes ever were. The tests did not cover anything that wasn't in the lectures/homework/papers, but they covered a vast amount of content. Take good notes on the lectures AND study them and you should be fine. \n\nHomeworks: The homeworks are optional but not optional if you want to do well on the tests. \n\nPapers: There were several academic papers for us to read. They varied in difficulty, but a couple of them were very long. However, the tests and the projects didn't seem to test our knowledge of them very extensively (other than what was in the homeworks). \n\nLectures: These are good, but they are not very consistent in the amount of detail covered. Some topics are covered in much detail while others are not. It would be nice if each one had optional readings associated with them. The are very few difficult concepts presented in the class. \n\nOverall Thoughts: Having never taken an undergraduate networking course, I felt like I learned a good bit in this class. The class really isn't that hard. I felt like it was worthwhile for me.",

The course required Python programming experience, there were multiple projects and 2 online proctored exams. I \"hated\" the proctored exams.... as these exams made me feel like I am in high school. During the proctored exam, we were not supposed to look away from screen, we can't move, can't think... just stare at the screen. The projects were not interesting. There was no team work either, which I believe is really important for such classes as we learn from each other. Professors and TA's were great, but I believe that there is a lot of room for improvement in the course content, assignments, projects and the structure of the entire class.",

All projects are good and doable in few hours - but you have to spend a lot more to make sure that you don't make a typo / small mistake. A small mistake in any of the project means that you lost \"A\" grade... My suggestion will be that if you are looking for \"A\" - make sure that you spend those extra hours to iron out any issues. \n\nTests are closed book. So, that's a bummer - I haven't done closed book written test in a while. But then closed-book tests are more helpful retaining the concepts. For both tests - I studied for 3 days straight and took exam at the end of 3rd day - 3 days were enough. \n\nVideos are good and helpful. Extra readings are boring and elaborate - but you don't need to read everything - you need to focus on key concepts. \n\nOffice hours were useful and I spent time watching all of them offline. The discussions in office hours will give you tips for your projects and help u out with key concepts on tests. \n\nGood course overall - definitely recommended. The only concern is that you are more worried about loosing the points than earning points.",

I thought the first was pretty easy and the homeworks prepared you for it. The second I thought deviated quite a bit from the homeworks. Since it's closed book and you get just 2 hours, I was screwed on that one. I wish they made it clearer what topics will be on the test. Also, there were only two tests during the semester.

                        "body": "I had an extremely difficult time in this course. The lectures were actually pretty good throughout the first half of the course but became more technical and less well explained during the second. The projects were not difficult, but I don't feel that they added anything to my understanding of the concepts. \n\nThe major problem I had with this course was the quizzes. The multiple choice questions were loaded with ambiguous answers, which still seemed ambiguous after watching the lectures multiple times and scouring Google for information. It often felt like you were left with 2 or 3 equally plausible choices and then forced to make a guess. There were multiple times where I felt like I actually, thoroughly understood what the question was asking and how each of the answers worked, but still had to just guess which was the \"best\" answer. \n\nThe free response questions weren't as tricky, but only gave you 90-120 words to explain your solution. There were 2 times in the beginning where I was penalized for not including all the information - I knew the information that I had left out, I tried to imply it in the response as much as possible, but didn't know how to get it all in there given the short answer length. I felt like I was being penalized not because of my understanding, but because of some weird artificial limitation. After this, rather than trying to explain my solution, I wrote down shorter jargon filled answers that, truthfully, I sometimes didn't fully understand and ended up getting full credit. This to me seems like a flaw - it felt to me that the grade was less about understanding and more about memorization. \n\nThis may be a harsh review, but I really didn't like this class."

Now there are 2 exams, roughly corresponding with midterm and final. There is probably about 7-10 academic papers to read. The video lectures are from the old format, and don't match up well with the projects or papers. The video lectures also tend not to explain things well or thoroughly. I found myself on multiple occasions going to wikipedia to look up topics in order to understand them better. Fairly easy class.",

They were quick with grades and responding to questions on Piazza and were very helpful. My review below is not a reflection of the Instructors, but solely the content and assignments for the course. \n\nI was quite disappointed in this course. The projects were simple and typically didn't require much effort assuming basic Python knowledge; Less than 2 hours each. I would've expected the projects to be more challenging considering my undergraduate Computer Networks class involved implementing a subset of functionality for an FTP server in C, given only the RFC document. The exams, of which there were 2, were typical memorize and regurgitate style with multiple choice and free response questions through ProctorTrack. \n\nThe content did not fit what I expected from a Computer Networks class. It seemed to be a hodge podge of select topics in the computer networking realm. I honestly didn't get much out of the class. \n\nIf you want an easy class and are ok with the typical memorize and regurgitate style of exams, then this is the class for you.",

The videos are pretty straight forward, and you have to know videos and papers for the TESTS. We only had 2 tests, but were supposed to have many----next semester I think they will do more. The projects were cool and interesting(know your Python), once you figured out how to get started. That might be my one recommendation is that sometimes we really had no idea how to get started. They definitely expect the \"figuring it out\" part is the first step of each project and is crucial to understanding. The autograders were a bit scary, cause even when you got the project working, you were worried whether your project would pass or not. Our last project has an autograder we had access to, so we knew for sure. Hopefully that will become the norm. My advice, the projects are very doable if you start early. Those who waited really seemed to panic at the end. TA (esp Michael) were extremely communicative in Piazza, so use that site daily for questions and updated. The course looks like they are redesigning, so there is definitely some re-ordering that needs to be done between readings, quizzes, and projects. But, overall good course with appropriate level of time commitment.",

I got a pretty high mark in this class (97), so I thought I would share a couple of tips that might help others that are planning to take it:\n\n1. As mentioned in the other reviews, some of the questions on the quizzes can be vague and easily misinterpreted. My approach on the quizzes was to make sure I researched each question throughly, considered all possible interpretations, and if necessary, post a private message to the Instructors requesting clarification. I tried to ensure my questions were concise, clear (sighting examples where possible), and demonstrated that I understood the related material throughly. In my experience, Prof Lillethun and the TAs were forthright and always willing to clarify things. \n\n2. Use office hours effectively! Office hours are your opportunity to speak to the Prof about the material and get answers and direction on homework, quizzes, and projects. The Instructors were willing to put a lot of time into the office hours, so take advantage of it. \n \n3. In advance of the quiz, they provide homework questions and answers. The homework answers are very useful on the quizzes. Use them. \n\n4. T-square sucks. When you answer a question that accepts multiple answers, do not guess at an answer. Incorrect choices will be deducted from any correct choices. So be conservative. Don't gamble on choices that you aren't sure of. \n \n5. T-square sucks. Make sure you record your answers and back them up on your computer. \n\n6. The projects aren't very hard, but you do need to have *some basic* programming. experience. If this isn't you, you might as well use this course to begin developing that experience (because Python is a good first language to learn, and you will certainly need it on other courses in the program). Prepare for the class by learning how to use basic data structures (maps, lists, sets), write methods, and declare variables. This is basic stuff, but a number of people seemed unprepared."

Here are my thoughts on the class:\nPRO:\n- Projects were very interesting and relevant. \n- Homeworks were good and the professor provided good answers\n- Office Hours were good and often provided hints and good discussion on homeworks and tests\n- Tests were tricky and required a lot of time to complete\n- The class had an active Piazza and students were very willing to help with questions\nCON:\n- While the video lectures were good, they did not provide the depth required for this class\n- Tests: Since there were only 10 questions on each test, each wrong answer could have a negative effect on your overall grade. Bomb a test, and it could drop you a letter grade. \n- Projects: Not much assistance was offered, and if you got stuck on a coding issue, not much help was available (except from Piazza, see above)\nTIPS for the CLASS:\nIf you are thinking about taking this class, here are some useful tips:\n- PYTHON - make sure you have good Python programming skills. If not, you will struggle with the projects. The class assumes you can write Python programs. \n- If you didn't take an undergraduate Networking class, consider getting the suggested textbook: Computer Networking - A Top Down Approach. This was helpful\n- Attend (or watch afterwards) all the Office Hours - very helpful and critical to my passing the class (professor gives good hints on the tough test questions)\n- Read all the posts on Piazza. Again this provided hints and details on tough test questions. \n- And don't forget to have fun!",

A large portion of your time will be spent trying to figure out semantics of obscure test questions, troubleshooting faulty project templates, and arguing with instructors. \n\nIt is true the content of this course does not demand a large number of hours per week to read or watch. However, the open-book format of the tests is IN NO WAY an advantage. The \u201cselect all that apply\u201d multiple-choice scheme was deemed unfair by MANY students, mostly because of the way T-Square deducts points for incorrectly selected options. Watching the lecture videos, reading the papers, and even participating in office hours do NOT lay the path for scoring well on the tests. \n\nThe projects can be a good source of learning the material, despite the fact they are 80% reading instructions and looking over the supplied templates and 20% actually writing code. \n\nIn the Fall 2015 session, the instructors were mostly attentive to students\u2019 concerns (via Piazza and office hours), even if some answers included \u201cthat\u2019s just the way it is, it cannot be changed. \u201d (This was a common response referring to tests in T-Square). I think the instructors were probably doing the best they could with the atrocious class they were given.

Both the original content and the delivery of that content are atrocities to the OMSCS program. As stated below, this class IN NO WAY does justice to this VERY important field of Computer Science. If you decide to take this class, and learning the material and scoring well is important to you, PREPARE TO BE THOROUGHLY FRUSTRATED.",

The instructors are trying to make it artificially hard because the reviews from previous semesters were saying that the course is easy. The result is vaguely worded tests, disappointing grades that are curved down, and core material that is still easy. \n\nThe lectures are good because they cover an interesting range of topics (a broader range than other networking classes I've seen). But they lack a bit in depth and need to be augmented. The current instructors are not the developers of the course and in some instances have a different approach. However they claim that they cannot change a single video segment or annotate it because \"it is easier to redevelop the entire course than it is to change one bit of it. \" I find this claim ridiculous at best. \n\nThe projects are very interesting but a bit easy. Those can definitely be made more challenging. \n\nThe quizes are a mess. They're vaguely worded and depend on the instructor's interpretation. They tend to be open ended, but you're expected to answer with a multiple choice or be constrained to 200 words. And in most cases, you're penalized because either you missed a nuance that's only clear in the instructor's mind, or because you didn't elaborate (although you're constrained to 200 words). My grades were like a crap shoot, totally random per quiz, for an equal amount of preparation for each quiz and understanding of the material. \n\nThe office hours were like a morning radio show with banter and little substance. I can tell that the instructors were trying hard to curve down the grades. Initially they claimed that an A will only be 92 and above (they reduced it later to a 90). They finally settled on the vaguely worded tests to make the course appear to be hard even though that's the wrong way to do it.",

Even when valid arguments were given for bad questions no credit was normally given. Meaning people never really well explained how they were wrong. \nLast project didn't work well and instead of fixing just made it optional as a way to replace. Project was really interesting and wish it had been fixed. \nTAs were fairly helpful in Piazza but the Professor was very slow at responding to things needing his attention. Overall many times got more clarification from classmates than from the TA or professor on Piazza. I feel lucky we had some talkative classmates. \nAlot of need to research outside sources to get answers to test questions. Not testing my understanding but my ability to clarify the statements. \nVideos didn't spend enough time explaining complex concepts forcing extra research as well.",

                        "body": "This is your warning: steer clear of this class. If at all possible, avoid taking it until the instructors have raised the quality bar. \n\nComputer Networks is an interesting and important field of study within Computer Science. This is knowledge that you should gain. Unfortunately, the structure and presentation of this class is incredibly frustrating and ambiguous. You still really struggle to get an A in this class because the class is poorly designed. The content isn't inherently challenging. The class is just designed to make it hard to do well. \n\nLectures: the lectures are quite poor and disorganized. There is no clear thread tying them together and complex concepts pop up and vanish again for the remainder of the course within a single breath... until they show up later on a quiz (more below). The lecture content has tremendous breadth but is frequently covered at such a shallow and unclear level that it is practically useless. If you want to spend hours reading Wikipedia articles, trying to understand what the professor is trying to teach, take this course. \n\nTests/quizzes: oh boy... most quizzes are \"select all of the correct responses\" style. Which means that 6-question quizzes essentially entail digging for minutia in order to discount even a single potential response. Prepare yourself for hours of Google + Wikipedia + watching random YouTube videos in the hope of uncovering a kernel that may/may not help you answer the question. Frequently, the wording on quizzes was so ambiguous that Piazza was flooded with questions and office hours were spent asking the instructor to clarify the same question over and over again. What seems like an easy \"1 quick quiz per week or two\" turns into a 3-4 day treasure hunt with the hope that an instructor might properly explain the intent of a question/answer option. \n\nProjects: the only good part of this course. The projects were occasionally a bit trivial but gave some programming practice in Python and helped to give a few concepts the depth of understanding that they deserve. Even the projects though were fraught: the instructors had to make the last project optional since so many people weren't able to understand it/make it run on their virtual machines. \n\nI'll repeat it again: this class is not inherently challenging. From previous semesters, it looks like this class was \"take this if you want an A\" easy. Instead of making projects more challenging or treating the content at any additional depth, the instructors simply made it more difficult to get an A. This course is difficult because of ambiguity, a lack of depth and poor assessments. \n\nIn case you were wondering, these concerns were raised to the instructors multiple times on Piazza throughout the semester. Each time, they were met with a shrug or a reason why the students' concerns were invalid. For me, this exemplifies a lack of awareness and understanding among the instructors for students who are just trying hard to learn. \n\nKeep in mind that I'm currently scoring in the 85%+ range. I put in a lot of time for this class. I wish I could have invested that time elsewhere.",

Tests were ridiculously vague and poorly phrased, requiring me to guess what the instructors had in mind rather than demonstrate my knowledge (I read AND watched all videos, practice questions and answers, office hours, etc. ) To be clear: I'm getting a strong A, and I really enjoyed the course material.

The projects seem to make sense but if your code fails one of the unreleased tests, you don't get any sort of feedback so you can't go back and understand what you did wrong.

They give you an expected solution to match and most of the time, you should be able to reach it. There are quizzes and they do take time to get right. They are not trivial, it requires reading, looking up stuff online and researching to get correctly. Course lectures ARE NOT ENOUGH. While the class is not mathematically intense or technically complex, you get a solid understanding of the concepts and material.

This made Piazza a terrible tool for communication. You had to watch Piazza pretty closely to keep tabs on the various quiz questions for that week. Also, while the quizzes *were* poorly worded and vague (which is unacceptable for any CS class), some students were quite rude to the TAs, who were trying to handle 500 students. I'd echo the sentiments above about the autograder too. GT should provide some automated grading framework like web-cat to handle that load instead of TAs writing custom, fragile auto graders. This way students could validate their code before submitting. I found the lectures very informative, the quizzes at their best made you go learn new things and at their worst confused the heck out of you with vague and imprecise language. I came into the class with zero networking knowledge or Python knowledge and I came out with an A. Don't take it expecting to learn Python. The most complex code you'll write is a loop. I do feel like the lectures were very beneficial though and enjoyed watching them. If they offer this class in the same format again (which I doubt they will), be sure to check Piazza often as there are some pretty funny exchanges between rude students who take themselves a bit too seriously and TAs that are stretched a bit too thin.",

The assignments are basically extremely simple tutorials. You don't even have to watch any of the lectures and you can still be very succesful (grade wise) in this course.

The lectures are decent, and you can learn something if you take the time on it, but learning is not a requirement for this one.",

AFAIK there is no professor supervising the TAs and there has been some snark on Piazza between the students and the TAs. (The majority of the students are probably older, and likely more experienced than the TAs, so that's a factor to consider. ) The quiz questions and answers are sometimes very cryptic, and some of the course communications aren't always written in proper English. Some of the quiz text appears to be plagiarized from other sources because the content is not covered in readings or lectures. I have printed the quiz out and kept it handy while watching lectures which basically makes it easy to ace most of the questions. The TAs are also sticklers for following the directions, but we had the same issue in CS6300... some people just don't follow directions. I am mostly satisfied, though, because these issues have not gotten in the way of my learning, and I have a pretty decent understanding of Python so the assignments are not that challenging.",

I'm also going to suggest that perhaps the class was too large to be effectively managed, and perhaps 200-300 students should be the max on a course at the graduate level given the time commitments of not only the students, but also the TAs involved. Having more TAs doesn't necessarily solve all issues that arise from such a large class in a variation on the maxim of the mythical man-month.",

Here, the lectures are ok. But the 'lab' part of the assignments really need to be reworked-they are not challenging and often involved mindlessly following step by step instructions. Also on the negative side, the quizes were poorly written, not particularly challenging and often contained errors. TAs were slow to return quizes and there was a 'negotiation' on piazza after a quiz was graded, and then the quizes were regraded.

I can 2nd that some of the quiz questions where plagiarized word-for-word from various places on the internet. In fact, one question was copied word-for-word - the answer from that site and the accepted answer in the class were different. I asked about this to a TA and his response was 'Sorry we can't pre-grade your quiz' and subsequent follow ups to clarify was left unanswered. Homework and quizes were not graded in a timely manner at all. I did learn stuff, but this didn't seem like a grad-level course.",

The lectures are ok (if not hard to follow due to the robotic speech of the instructor), but the assignments are awful. Each assignment is 1/2 coding & simulation, and 1/2 quiz. The quizzes were written by someone with absolutely no grasp of technical writing, or the English language in general. Project requirements were subject to change, and these changes weren't regularly stickied or announced. The coding required was extremely simple since most of the code is already written, and the hardest part is reading documentation. I would not recommend this course under any circumstances. If you want to learn about computer networks, you are better off watching the lectures and reading on your own.",

The quizzes were poorly worded, ambiguous, and confusing. The provided virtual machine was a pain to use and sometimes I spent a couple hours trying to fix problems--my advice is to read, then re-read, and follow the assignment instructions exactly as written. Probably the hardest part of the course was learning Python which I had no knowledge of beforehand. It is somewhat easy class that could be taken along with a more difficult class.",

We got ten chances on each quiz, so even though the questions were fairly vague, answer the ones you know first, then build up incrementally answering a few more on each try to see where you're wrong. I kind of hate the quiz structure that rewards gaming like that, but given the chance, why wouldn't you? They're giving you free 100s if you approach it correctly. \n\nMy experience was improved by taking this at the same time I took Prof Feamster's SDN course on Coursera. This was by far the most interesting part of the course for me and it really hammered home all of the layers beneath Pyretic that we just kind of gloss over in the Georgia Tech course. It also gave a whole bunch of extra progamming assignments and exposure to some newer technologies that improve upon Pyretic or expand its capabilities. Overall, the course is far too easy on its own, but the material itself is very interesting and if you dig a little deeper and do some extra work on your own, you can still get just as much out of it as you get out of the more stand-alone challenging courses. Do the mininet and OpenFlow and Pyretic tutorials on each project's website and understand what these technologies are doing, ahead of when it comes up in the course.",

The projects were fairly basic and were not challenging from a programming point of view (I had relatively minimal experience with Python before the course, but pick up scripting languages pretty easily). The hard part with the programming assignments was that they were auto-graded with minimal viewing of the code so a simple mistake could cause significant issues on the grade.

The class have been basically unprofessional. For a class that is in its 3rd run I don't know why it is this bad. KBAI was infinitely better on its first run. The videos are nice and the homework itself isn't bad but when you have a case where a you do what is in the homework and match their pictures, only to have things rejected because of OTHER unannounced parameters.. its not good. Or to then have them request you copy and paste output from a terminal, only to find out that they watned MORE than they explicicity asked for is bad. What makes it worse than just all of that is their refusal to make a group announcement about the subject where it states EVERYTHING in one clear place.

There is no professor involved with the course at this point, so it is entirely run by a group of TAs who do their best to make everything work but don't have the resources, time, or authority to fix the aspects of the course that are broken. The course consists of lectures, which in general are interesting and easy to follow, short Python networking assignments, and quizzes. If all of these were integrated into the Udacity system as they were originally when the course was created, everything would be much easier to deal with. Instead, the current TAs are locked out of the Udacity backend and have to create their own autograding system and quiz questions from scratch. Autograding has been a mess, with students receiving zero scores for seemingly correct work with no explanation, such as programming assigningments where the code is completely correct or quiz submissions where there is an extra newline at the end of the file. The TAs are spending a lot of time regrading and fixing these grading errors, but it's a huge distraction from the actual coursework. The quiz questions themselves are the weakest and newest part of the course, many of the questions are incorrect and are changed before the deadline, worded ambiguously due to grammar or other issues, cover material outside of the course itself, or use terminology and techniques simlar to but different from the course material. All these issues mean that there is a large backlog of questions from students on Piazza, and the TAs have a hard time keeping up. To succeed in this course procrastination is basically mandatory, because critical clarifications and changes to the quizzes and assignments will often only be posted a few days before the deadline. Aside all of these issues, the material in the course itself is very approachable and the workload is very reasonable in terms of time. I wish the higher level staff would do something to address the problems faced by both students and TAs in this course, because otherwise I would recommend this course a good way to get started in the OMSCS program without getting overwhelmed by courses that involve more advanced skills and a larger time committment.",

The lectures have continued to be good, but the rest of the class experience has been a disappointment. I feel for the TAs - it seems like there has been ZERO involvement from the professor of record now that he's moved on to Princeton. The TAs are left holding the bag, and things have been very disorganized as a result. The programming assignments are almost laughably easy (I completed most in less than an hour), but the multiple-choice quizzes take a ridiculous amount of time. A lot of the questions are so incredibly vague or the answers just didn't make any sense - in some cases, there were no correct answers available, which was acknowledged by the TAs on the course forum. My general process for handling the quizzes was to watch the lectures, read any supplemental papers that were linked, read the Piazza forum, watch the office hours... and when all that failed, as it frequently did, Google for the answers. I'm not exaggerating when I say that a 10-question multiple choice quiz can take upwards of 6 or 7 hours to complete. The Piazza forum itself is another issue... it's very frequently difficult to get any sort of 'official' response from a TA to questions. Students are helping each other as much as possible, but it would be nice to get official confirmation for questions that relate to policy/procedures. This is my first semester in the program, and I would have been really disappointed and questioning the caliber of the program if I weren't taking CS6300 concurrently.",

The python programming itself was not difficult, but you did have to spend time understanding the concepts and the other code with which you were interfacing. Even though I felt like I knew the answers on the quizes, the quizes took extra time because of the ambiquity of the wording on some of the questions.

I took this course because I wanted to take a course that had a low difficulty level and would help meet one of the foundational requirements. Unfortunately, we spent more time debating the quiz & assignmenting file-naming conventions than actually discussing the content of the course. e. g. One assignment we were required to name a file 'quiz4', another assignemnt we have to name a file 'quiz-7' with a '-' character. Students obsessed over these details since the autograder scripts apparently cannot accept filenames with even the slightest variation (no wildcard characters??). All of the problems from this semester stem from a lack of leadership. There was no leadership from the TAs; not something entirely expected but it really hurt the course. The faculty of Georgia Tech provided no communication about this course's professor or his absence. There was no attempt to repair the course that clearly got off to a rough start. Although the content was somewhat interesting, we could never benefit from professorial interaction. I will not recommend this course to a fellow student until it is improved.",

The professor seems to be very aloof, and the course is entirely ran by teaching assisants who are not very attentive on the forum. Most of the help you get will be from fellow students, given the size of the class, I'd say you'll bound to find help from good students. The assignments are horribly designed and not well tested before deployment. The quiz questions are ambigous, causing a lot of frustration. The quiz are not difficult at all, Most of the admitted students are smart and will be able to comprehend the material in the video lecture easily. So imagine how they can design the multiple choice questions to test your IQ? They make them very ambiguous so you might just choose the wrong answer even you understand everything they taught just fine. in Fall 2014 80% of the student got an A. No mid term no finals, just 10 easy programming assignments + multiple choice questions. Just brush up on your python programming (you need to be able to read code from framework, you only need to write a few lines for each assignment). A great deal of the frustration you'll get is to understand the python mininet API framework, which is the center piece of every assignment but none of the lecture video cover the framework at all. Use a good editor like pycharm so you can jump to definition of the framework python code. That's all you need.",

However, when you get to the quizzes, it sometimes requires you to review the lectures for a second time since the lectures can explain concepts pretty fast or go to external references to determine the answer. Some of the quiz multiple choice answers are also worded vaguely and can be tricky. I enjoyed the assignments. I think I also spent a lot of time catching up with all the posts made by the class to determine what bugs to look out for or clues to help solve the assignment. Overall, I still believe this is a good introductory to OMSCS class to take if you are willing to do the work.",

You have up to 10 tries which helps (although you don't know which questions you got right/wrong). The projects weren't very difficult however they did take some time to understand. Six projects (10% each), five quizzes (8% each). One per week. Overall I enjoyed the course.",
