It would have been nice if there was a disclaimer saying \"There will be no TA support in this course.\" With a topic as interesting as Operating Systems, I would have expected *some* level of interaction from the TAs. But there was none. Zilch. Nada. Only some bare bones comments from time to time. I've been a TA in my past life and I would be ashamed if I were in any one of their places.\n\nTo top it off, the first assignment is awful I went into it thinking \"Hey if I get my basics and algorithm right I'll be fine.\" Unfortunately these morons have < 75 IQ and can only grade based on graphs, not code. I lost a lot of points in it without any fault of mine at all. In the end I did manage to secure an A but only because I had a lot of anxiety and I over-prepared for the exams. \n\nThis course isn't going to teach you anything about diving deep into an operating system. A more appropriate name would be \"Survey of Systems-related topics fro last three decades.\"\n\nThat being said, it's hard to judge the value of such a course immediately after you take it. The benefits are a bit more long-term. If you took GIOS, you may remember the adage \"every problem in computer science can be solved by adding another level of indirection.\" This course really reinforces that. I enjoyed reading most papers, if not all.\n\nI want to take SDCC eventually and was even looking forward to it. But if the same shithead TAs and the level of commitment from them exists over there, I wouldn't be too happy.\n",

                        "body": "Instead of talking about the mechanics of the course, I am just going to talk about succeeding in this class.\n\nI think the difficulty of this course is overblown. It's ~3.5/5.0. The exams are easier than GIOS and the difficulty of the projects is also less than GIOS.\n\nThis is a *time intensive* course. On average the time commitment may be about the same as GIOS, but it is less consistent week to week. Particularly on exam weekends, you will need to devote a lot of time to the class. Therefore, it is important to *efficiently utilize your time*. \n\n**Ways to save time** \n\n*Don't attend hangouts: * I attended the weekly hangouts, but got nothing out of them, and I recommend forgoing the 0.5 bonus points. If you have watched the lectures, the hangout is useless, just a rehash of the lecture. If you didn't watch the lectures, you have no idea what's going on, and your time would be better served watching the lectures. The slides released from the hangouts *are* useful, but they are freely available.\n\n*Don't work with a partner: * I did, and I don't recommend it. None of the projects were very large. The features that need to be completed were small, and working with a partner just adds overhead due to the granularity of tasks. At best with a good partner and can work 20% faster. At worst you get a crap partner and wish you worked alone. My partner was fine but would sleep on PRs >24h which probably brought the benefit to 0%. It's also really hard to pick a partner, it's not like a live class where you have an idea what people are like.\n\n*Only read papers you must: * If a pre-released exam question is not covered by the lectures (and 90% of them are) sure, skim the paper. For two projects you also need to read papers. Other than that, don't prioritize it. IMO reading the papers does not add a great deal of benefit to the course. The lectures summarized the core ideas of the papers, this is the value of the course. If you have time, go for it--or better yet, just reading papers that interest you. Some of the papers in this class are pretty esoteric (with a heavy bias to Kishore's research).\n\n**Other thoughts:**\n\n*First homework: * This is IMO the most important assignment of the class. Although it is only worth a few points, this provides a preview of an exam. If you took the homework, memorized it and retyped it from memory, that would be an exam. Treat the homework like exam 0, and pay attention to how it is graded.\n\n*Exams: * Think for yourself. Usually there is a collaboration document, it can be wrong. Come up with your own answers and check against the collab document for obvious mistakes. If you believe in your answers and they differ from the collab document, go with them, paste them in the document and move on. It is a lot easier to memorize answers that you came up with and are your words.\n\n*Lecture Notes: * My notes were verbose and comprehensive. Don't think of your notes as something you have to memorize for the exam, think of them as a reference for the class. When the exam is released you can look through your notes and find little details instead of wasting time re-watching lectures. When doing the exam pre-release if clarification from the videos is required, it will be easy to know exactly what to re-watch based on your notes.\n\n*One time extension: * Don't use it unless you absolutely have to. The class moves fast, if you need it, you're already dead.\n\nOverall I enjoyed the class, but think it doesn't deserve its reputation. The exams were more straightforward than GIOS and overall, the class is very reasonable. The teaching team is pretty hands off, but also super chill about things; you don't feel like you are walking between landmines like you do with instructional staff from other classes. I'd take this class again. \n\nWhy listen to me? I'm waiting on final grades but could get a 50 on the last exam and get an A. (P.S. Spring **2024**)",

                        "body": "I really wanted to like this class more than I actually did, because it has so much potential and is uniquely interesting compared to any other class I've taken. It has the most involved OMSCS instructor by a country mile who is not only extremely knowledgeable, but genuine and passionate about the content he teaches. I rate the difficulty a 4/5 because of the amount of assigned readings and exams that consume your entire weekend, but honestly I think most of the pressure and stress was self-induced because I took every aspect of the class so seriously when in retrospect I didn't need to. I rate the course itself a 2/5 not barely of the content and assignments and moreso because I think there are significant improvements on how the course is logistically run. \n\nNOTE: I did everything alone, but I think you can work with a partner for projects 2, 3, and 4. Perhaps me going solo has affected the way I have rated the class.\n\nPros:\n- I love professor Kishore\n- Many of the concepts you're exposed to are interesting thought experiments, and the content in general is fun to think about\n- The coding assignments are engaging\n- Extra credit (showing up to synchronous lectures/summaries, and CIOS completion dependent on how many students complete it)\n\nCons:\n- TAs are not active on Ed, most of our questions were answered by another student (shoutout to him, a big W)\n- Sometimes the synchronous lectures would go past 8, which isn't mentioned in the syllabus\n- While 80% the exam questions are released during the weekend of an exam beforehand, they didn't actually release it at the said time of 11:59 PM EST (for exams 1,2, and 3 they released them ~2  hours late, 15 minutes late, and 30 minutes late respectively, so just anticipate that if you plan on staying up late to see the questions like me)\n- Exams feel like memorization sometimes\nWhile I expect some ambiguity with projects, I felt like assignments had a little too much of that and in combination with the lack of TA action on Ed made this worse (there were incorrect instructions in assignment 2 and no support for the setup in project 3 - the provided files didn't even build unless you made modifications to them unrelated to the project).\n\nTips:\n- For exams, find (or create) and work on the shared document that students will collaborate on.\n- You don't need to read all the papers in their entirety. Actually, you probably don't need to read any and can get by watching lectures. Some of the required readings aren't even mentioned in lectures or exams. They're interesting and quickly reading/skimming some definitely helps your understanding though.\n- Get started early on the projects, but not too early (if I had waited 24-48 hours before coding, many of the roadblocks I had run into would be mentioned by someone else on Ed and would eventually be figured out by another student)",

(I found with GIOS that it was necessary to spend a lot of time figuring out the provided skeleton code and what you were even supposed to be doing - this was not a problem in AOS).\n\nThe tests are hard, and if you take this class MAKE SURE YOU ARE ON THE TEST COLLABORATION DOCUMENT. Tests are short answer with 80% of the questions released in advance and you're allowed to collaborate on them. I was not aware of this for the first test and I did badly in part because of that. I am of the opinion that the test format is stupid - memorizing answers to the released questions doesn't feel great.\n\nMy final complaint is one that is shared amongst many OMSCS classes, namely that it's disorganized and is badly in need of a Spring Cleaning. There is conflicting information in various places across Canvas and Ed Discussion. Due dates for certain things weren't clear. The Canvas modules are badly organized.\n\n",

Overall, I do recommend this class for people in the computing systems track.\n\nProjects\nEasily the best part of the course and some of the best in the OMSCS program so far (this was my 5th class). They're all in C and C++ and follow the lectures very well. There were some environment setup issues in the instructions this semester, but nothing that didn't stop these from being very well designed.\n\nLectures\nPretty clear to understand for the most part, but honestly the content was fairly dry at times. Other times pretty interesting. I watched them all at 2x speed. As most OMSCS courses also follow, it was mostly summarizing research papers from over a decade ago.\n\nExams\nKind of hated the format tbh. They release 80% of the questions beforehand and the other 20% are hidden questions that usually pretty closely follow previous exam questions. This was kind of just an exercise in memorizing your answers to the 80% and memorizing the past exam questions based on your guess of what the content will be. It felt like it was too detailed in terms of memorizing the specific steps from the papers of the class instead of applying them to a new subject. It would be great if the exams were more like IHPC, which were all open note (no memorization) but had challenging questions that aren't google-able.",

Exams are take home, usually taking up a weekend (don't plan for anything else). Questions are very involved and require a lot of rote memorization\n\nGenerally, lectures are enough to prepare for exams. Papers will help, but rewatching the lectures will also help. Keep in mind that if you're collaborating on a shared doc with the rest of the class, some answers that people suggest won't be right (there's usually at least one correct one though)\n\nThe amount of work required to get an A in this class is pretty significant (concentrated in exam prep). The amount of work required to get a B will be much less\n",

I thoroughly enjoyed the last project. What makes it really stressful is that the deadlines are pretty much back to back. Often times, the project deadline might overlap with one of the exams' deadline.\n\nUndecided on what I thought about the exams since it probably takes a lot of stress off the students given that questions were released before. This allows for a lot of discussion regarding the answers. Of course, there are students who don't ever contribute and just leech off whatever answers are given by active students.\n\nSo students just end up memorizing whatever answers come their way a day before the exam. Evidently, you can see students only appearing on Slack a day before the exam and asking for the collaboration doc link to get answers. On average, probably only 20 contributors out of a class of ~400? For that, it might make sense to make it completely closed book instead.\n\nContent is fantastic and Kishore is so infectious with his enthusiasm!

For the time I sunk into this course I did not feel I got as much as I should have.\nWhile I feel I learned some interesting ideas, I don't see a lot of the concepts covered as\npractical to my career, which is why I was disappointed.\n\nI'm open to learning about random research ideas, but only if they have a practical tie-in to\nthe field as it stands. While I found value out of the course projects, all the other auxillary\nassignments and assignments ultimately didn't make the course worth it as a whole in my opinion.\n\n_Should I take this?_\n\nIf it's your first course in OMSCS? I wouldn't.\n\nIf you haven't taken GIOS and don't have a solid systems understanding? Take GIOS first, and then decide.\n\nOtherwise, if you're unsure if you should go for a PhD or go into academia in your career,\ntake this class and see if your mindset and goals are conducive to this course's design.\nIf you enjoy the class and the research papers that come with it, you might be well prepared for\nfurther education and a career in academia.\n\nIf you don't care for either, skip this course and do GIOS if you want to learn OS concepts.\n\n## Background\n\n* This is my first course in the OMSCS program.\n* I was fairly proficient with the concepts presented in the pre-req check and was\na TA for my undergraduate OS course, so I figured it was safe to skip GIOS.\n\n## Projects\n\n0. pthread based warmup exercise (C, involves finding 5 bugs)  \n   Time spent: 10h\n1. VM vCPU scheduler and memory controller (C, uses libvirt API)  \n   Time spent: 15h  \n   The libvirt docs weren't the best, but once you got over that it was mostly fine.\n2. Barrier syncronization primitives (C, uses OpenMP and MPI libraries)  \n   Time spent: 15h  \n   Really cool seeing the end graphs and figures, but using PACE cluster sucked.\n3. gRPC asyncronous hybrid client/server with threadpool (C++, uses gRPC)  \n   Time spent: 10h  \n   Once I got accustomed to the gRPC asyncronous API calls it became fairly simple to handle.\n4. MapReduce framework (C++, uses gRPC)  \n   Time spent: 20h (about 15h implementation, 5h debug)  \n   Lots of boilerplate to understand. Cool end product, but definitely start ASAP.\n\n## Pros\n\n* The projects helped make sense of the lectures and demonstrated most of the lecture\n  topics, which I appreciated a lot.\n  * e.g. for Project 2 (writing different barriers) the benchmarks we collected clearly\n    demonstrated performance penalties incurred when choosing one specific style of barrier\n    over another for different types of parallel computing architectures.\n\n* Test questions were distributed ahead of time and collaboration was encouraged\n  among the class.\n\n## Cons\n\n* Live weekly hangouts that were mandatory.\n  * The alternative options to those who couldn't make it seemed slightly unfair.\n  * They also felt chock full of trick questions. The professor wouldn't give enough\n    time to think through the question either before closing the polls.\n\n* The professor is not good at being concise.\n  * The lectures seemed to drag on and the mandatory weekly hangouts would often go\n    past the allotted hour.\n\n* Tests. (Not to say tests are good, but these might be the hardest I've ever taken in my life.)\n  * Despite having the questions ahead of time and collaboration encouraged, the entire\n    class still found certain questions too vague and difficult to answer.\n  * TA's are looking for exact key phrases -- if you touch on the concept but don't\n    use the magic phrase they have developed tunnel vision looking for, then it's\n    questionable if you get points for it.\n\n* The reverance of whimsical research papers\n  * Some papers were useful and insightful, like the MCS paper on syncronization primitives.\n  * Some papers didn't make sense why they were being covered until it was told that they were\n    the basis of commonly used technologies.\n  * Some papers just flat out weren't, like the almost 30 year old papers about distributed\n    memory over LAN.\n    * Don't ask the course staff if they were ever implemented unless you want a rude and\n      unhelpful non-answer about how \"everything in this course is worth knowing.\"\n",

You get access to the questions on Friday night, and the whole class usually collaborates on a giant piazza thread and works its way through the test. I think we learn a lot from the conversations between people that eventually converge on an answer that's right. You cant use ur notes or anything when u start the exam so you do have to memorize everything you worked on and learned over the weekend but this is easy because by the end of the weekend, most things are well understood and its always easier to remember something you know than to memorize something u don't.\n\nProjects are challenging and can be time-consuming but not because of difficulty, I think because of ambiguity of requirements, except for the last project which is a MapReduce implementation (it's clear what you need to do for the project to be correct, but the design and details are up to you which allows some creativity.).\n1. virtualization, memory allocation, and scheduling project with a VM API\n2. openMP and openMPI algorithm implementations for barriers I believe and some experiments + a writeup\n3. gRPC-based multi-tier application. aka a client -> server -> another server. you work on the middleman\u2014kind of like a mini meta-API. \n4. MapReduce implementation with gRPC.\n\nlearning gRPC was time consuming for me\n\nlectures a high volume! like 3 hours of video a week sometimes\n\npapers are recommended but not necessary. some exam questions get pulled from them so do read important ones or remember to skim them when working on the exam over the weekend.\n",

This is my 4th class.\n\n**Projects:**\n\nProject 0: concepts check and threads \nI'm not fond of this homework\u2014just an unnecessary warmup.\n\nProject 1: Virtual Machine Scheduling in KVM(C, libvirtAPI)\n\nDesign & implement an algorithm to allocate/deallocate CPU & memory between VMs. I have redesigned my algorithm several times and spent 50 hours. I like the project and learned from it.\n\nProject 2: Barrier Synchronization (C, openMP & openMPI)\n\nBased on the paper and course contents, you pick up barrier algorithms to implement and then write a report. I spent around 40 hours. I wasn't exposed to openMP and openMPI before. It's nice to know. I like this project, and it helps me understand barriers much better.\n\nProject 3: Distributed Service using GRPC (C++, gRPC)\n\nImplement async client and server. The GIOS project 4 prepared me. At least this time, I already knew gRPC. This project also has some subtle parts that require thinking. I spent around 15 hours on it and had fun. It is nice to have a non-heavy project in the mid of the semester. \nI appreciate it.\n\nProject 4: Implement MapReduce Framework (C++, proto3 ,gRPC)\n\nImplement a simple version of MapReduce based on the paper. Readme is well-written. It is a pretty cool project. I spent around 45 hours. The paper read time is not counted here. This is my favorite project so far in OMSCS.\n\nNote that I did all projects on my own. But you can also find a partner to work together from P2 to P4.\n\n**Lectures, papers, office hours, TAs:**\n\n1. The content is quite dense and requires time to think and understand. I learned a lot this semester. \n2. Besides two mandatory papers, I probably read through another five. There are also several other papers I only read the part I am interested in.\n3. I love the weekly meeting with Professor Kishore. He is nice and passionate about teaching. The office hour contents are well-designed with various quizzes. \n4. TAs are very helpful and active in the piazza.\n\n**Tests**\n\nSuch a relief the questions are given ahead and allow us to discuss in the piazza! Some questions are pretty hard, and there are no alignment and clues on the correct answers after tons of thinking and discussion. The exam week is stressful.",

You're allowed to work with a partner for projects 2-4 if you want. I did not, but was still able to finish the projects. Project 4 took the longest (they tell you to start early on this one: LISTEN TO THEM), followed by project 1, then 2 and 3. None of the projects are particularly hard, they are just time-consuming.\n- Professor is very invested in the class learning. He held office hours every week and was active on Piazza.\n- 1% grade bump if enough of the class does the CIOS survey at the end of the semester\n\nNeutral:\n- 0.5% grade bump if you attend 10 office hours, OR write summaries of 10 of them. I'm putting this in \"Neutral\" and not \"Pros\" because I felt this created more work for those who were unable to attend in person. I say this as someone who did attend in person so did not have to write any summaries. The office hours were held in the evening Atlanta time.\n- Tests were released in advance and we were able to collaborate with other students on the answers, though we had to take the test solo (closed everything). Why is this not in the pros section? Because the tests are HARD. The first test highest grade was in the mid-90s, average in the 80s. We were allowed to discuss the answers before taking it because, per the professor, he \"wants learning to occur\". However, I found that I would more so try to memorize some of the answers vs understand them when taking the test.\n\nCons:\n- We used an older version of gcc and gRPC in the class, which some of us were not aware of until submitting code to GradeScope. Either telling us the versions of everything beforehand or updating gcc/gRPC would be helpful.\n- The lectures tend to repeat themselves, as in the professor would explain a concept, then explain it again using slightly different words, then sometimes explain it a third time. I ended up watching the lectures at a faster speed because of this.\n- There are a list of papers that you're supposed to read throughout the semester. I didn't do this, I read 3 of them: 2 that I had to summarize, and 1 that was needed for project 4. Students are required to provide their summaries to everyone, so you can probably get away with reading the summaries, though I didn't even read those unless they papers came up on the test or projects.\n\nOverall, this class was somewhat interesting. Due to the difficultly of the tests I placed \"hard\" on this review for the difficulty, if the tests were easier it'd drop the overall difficulty a lot. If you're interested in distributed systems & virtualization, I'd recommend taking the course.",

The worst part about this class is the expectation of regurgitating very specific implementation details of obsolete or research systems on the exams, which are a good portion of the grade. \n\nThat said, if you are interested in system design, studying and learning about design decisions of said obsolete and research systems can be very insightful.\n\nI enjoyed the projects. Projects 1 and 4 took the most time. 1 because of having to learn libvirt and 4 because of the scope of the project (simplified MapReduce framework). Project 2 was a pure algorithms assignment and project 3, which took me less than 5 hours felt more like a breather project. Some of the requirements on gradescope can be unspecified and people in piazza post frustrations, which are justified.\n\nIf you don't stress out about getting an A, you can go in depth with just the papers you are interested in and watch lectures for the rest. \n\nAll in all a satisfying class and is the kind I would expect when I do a Master's Degree.",

As I got further into the course I found myself a lot more interested in the content and some of my frustration started to dissipate. The earlier parts of the course focused on traditional operating system design and considerations, but the course quickly started to focus on parallel and distributed systems. So much so that this course might be better named as \"Intro to Distributed Computing\" instead of \"Advanced Operating Systems\".\n\nIf you don't have proficiency with C/C++ or multi-threading, you may find this course extremely difficult. If that is the case I'd highly recommend taking GIOS first before you commit to taking AOS (especially because GIOS was designed to give the foundational knowledge required to succeed in AOS).\n\n**Pros**:\n- Professor Kishore is extremely passionate about the subject and it's almost infectious\n- The projects can be interesting\n- The lectures pack a ton of background information that comes directly from assigned readings\n- While attending office hours are part of your grade, they are absolutely worth attending. I found them more enjoyable than the pre-recorded lectures.\n\n**Cons**:\n- The amount of information feels like drinking from a fire hose, and it's extremely difficult to keep up with readings, lectures, and assignments.\n- Grading is not always straight forward and you may find yourself having to argue with TAs to regain lost points.\n\n**Exams**:\nThe exams are close book and open ended questions only. The test questions are released 3-4 days before the exam is due and students are allowed to collaborate with each other to come up with the best answers ahead of time. Regardless, these exams are still relatively difficult and grading is based on specific key talking points. Not all answers are directly from the lectures/readings, so you will be forced to think critically based on the information you've learned up to that point. You will learn a ton simply through the process of answering the exam questions.",

I think there is simply too much assigned material that is irrelevant, especially when the topics dive deep into the history of design decisions. It's interesting material for the most part, but it does detract from the high points of the topics. I have learned much more from other courses in the program while committing significantly less time. \n\nThe projects were OK. Fun at some points, but overall not very relevant to the material and I didn't have any eureka moments like I did with GIOS projects. Also in contrast with GIOS, the course is significantly less organized. Project requirements were vague and often contained errors that would cause issues in development. It got to the point where I was unsure if issues were due to an error on my part or the TAs, and this is very frustrating to encounter.\n\nI did like that the professor was very engaged in the course and has a genuine interest in the topics.\n\nThinning out the course topics to allow a deeper dive into the mechanics (not the history) of the remaining topics would go a long way to help this course. I think the biggest contributor to my disappointment was taking GIOS beforehand, mainly because GIOS is so streamlined. I would take this course if you just can't get enough of operating systems. If you have a lighter interest (like me), GIOS is sufficient.\n",

                        "body": "For the first time in my life, I felt out of my depth in this class. The material and projects were challenging, and my classmates all seemed to have years of low-level programming experience. In a small class with no credit given for Piazza participation, I quite often felt alone.\n\nBut three aspects of the class came to balance this. First, the Slack discussion was active and collaborative. Second, you were allowed to partner on the last three projects. And third, the professor held mandatory hangouts every week.\n\nThe professor obviously loves teaching this class, and his enthusiasm is infectious. Every 5 minutes of each hangout, he will poll the class on a particular concept. The questions were high-level, and yet often less than 70% of the polled answers were correct. Heck - I reasoned - if my classmates are consistently getting a third of these questions wrong, then maybe I do belong!\n\nThe professor sets very ambitious learning objectives for this class. But he also wants to reduce the stress as much as possible. To that end, everybody gets a \"One Time Forgiveness\" to extend their project deadline by 1 week. It seemed like most of the class took advantage of this at some point. And most for the last big Map-Reduce project.\n\nTo reach this high-learning / low-stress combination, the professor has been experimenting with the format of the exams. Until 2019, there was a big mid-term followed by a bigger-final. The final has been broken into two parts, so there are now three exams: a big first-mid-term (unchanged), a medium second-mid-term (half of the old final but longer), and a medium final. All exams are non-cumulative.\n\nThe professor also implemented a new \"open questions\" exam policy. We get the exam questions on Friday-midnight, then can take the exam anytime through to Monday. And there is an \"open collaboration\" exam policy, so we all get together and spend two days hashing out all the answers on Google Docs.\n\nUnfortunately there is a price to be paid for these changes, and some of the exam questions have gone from \"easy\" to \"omg\". After seeing the exam questions and the discussion, the class exam average was still only 85.\n\nThe exam questions themselves are not only fair and predictable, but also very insightful. Question 1 is on Topic 1. Question 2 is on Topic 2. And the questions always start out the same:\n\n\"You'll recall that technology A is designed to do B. Why did the designers use X implementation?\"\n\nI was often left wondering - yeah - that is a great question - why did they do it that way?!\n\nWe get all of the old exams going back to 2010, and I personally learned the most going through these old exams. I'd strongly recommend finishing 5 of these before attempting the new exam questions. While these old exams are still only the \"easy\" questions, they give you a solid foundation for the \"omg\" questions. Because most of the technologies we studied died around 1995, there are few surviving sources describing the implementations of the \"omg\" questions (the assigned research papers didn't seem to help). In the end, you were forced to choose from the half-dozen theories proposed by your classmates.",

                        "body": "Where to start with this course... it has its good moments, but overall I'd say I was pretty disappointed with it.\n\nI took GIOS before taking this course, and the difference in quality and content is considerable. First of all, some of the content overlaps with GIOS, while the rest of it is mostly case-study style learning where you read papers about some semi-obscure technology to learn about its design and why its architects designed it that way. Overall I'd say that compared to GIOS, the knowledge I gained through this course was pretty minimal. That's not to say I didn't learn anything, but this course has GIOS to compare it to, and well, GIOS is just awesome, so it's tough to live up to it I guess.\n\nThe projects start easy enough but they ramp up in difficulty fast. If you get a bad partner or decide to do the projects alone, good luck... I had an awesome partner and we could divide the work pretty much 50/50 without feeling like the other isn't contributing enough, and it was still a nightmare. They are not projects in the sense of \"here's the input, this is the expected output, make it work\". No, these projects are more like \"this is a 5 page description of how your program should kinda look like, now figure something out. Oh and it has to pass a hidden autograder and we won't provide any tests\". At least you can run the autograder an unlimited number of times...\nTo be fair, the professor and the TAs are very active on Piazza and answer any questions promptly and in depth (most of the time), so it makes life a bit easier for the projects. But that basically means that the entirety of Piazza threads for the couple of weeks that the projects are open are pretty much required reading if you wanna do well on the projects.\n\nAs for the professor... this guy doesn't really get the whole \"O\" aspect of \"OMSCS\". Mandatory live office hours that affect your grade? WTF? What about timezones? Well, there is the option to watch the recordings of office hours and write summaries, but like... that's double the work then.\nAlso, it is true that the professor is very very involved in this course. And very interested in his students. Like, very very interested in his students. Like, he asked for our pictures on more than one occasion. I'm trying to attribute that to the fact that he's trying to get as close to an \"in-person\" learning experience, but still, like, that's weird.\n\nThe lectures are fine, the professor explains everything clearly and sometimes explains the same concept in like 4 different ways, so there's a tendency to get repetitive, but I guess that's better than not explaining stuff well enough. Except... they're super loooong. Even on 2x speed they just go on and on and on... The thing is, a single \"lecture\" often spans at least 3 or 4 different topics, so when you think you're done with lecture 5, there's still lecture 5b, 5c, 5d, 5e and 5f to go through in the same week. And the \"segments\" are often about an hour or more each, so be prepared to spend more than just an evening on the lectures. In fact, for a person who only has evenings to allocate to this course, I found myself spending pretty much every evening either watching lectures, reading papers or doing the projects. Not to mention the days I had to take off work to finish the projects.\n\nThe only really good thing about this course are the exams. There's 3 of them and the questions are released publicly when the exam period opens, and can be discussed publicly before you actually take the exam. That doesn't mean the exams are easy, though. They cover pretty much everything discussed in the lectures at least in some way, and even though you can discuss the questions beforehand, unless you're super good at memorizing 50 one-paragraph answers, you pretty much have to understand the topics to be able to write a convincing answer. I think this is an awesome way to conduct exams, since the format gives you no choice but to actually understand and conceptualize everything that's on the exam (which is pretty much everything discussed in the lectures).\n\nAll in all, I did reasonably well in this class (got 100% on the projects and 95% and 85% on the first two exams, still waiting for the results on the last exam and last project), but it was hell on earth trying to keep up with all the load, the live office hours, etc... So I probably wouldn't take this course again if I had the choice. I think if the professor got rid of the live office hours, cut out some of the more pointless lecture topics, and provided some sort of public testing system for the projects, this course would be a decent choice. But as it is, it's a thumbs down from me."

Go in expecting a series of case studies related to software systems design, because that's all it is.\n\n* Most well-made class I've taken so far, and I'm 7/10 done including this class. There's an explicit theme that systems design is 1% inspiration and 99% perspiration, and this class will make you sweat. There's not much breathing time. It's a constant fire-hose. There's so many assignments that nothing's worth more than 16%. \n\n* 3/4 of the projects you can do in pairs, but they're pretty doable solo.\n\n* The professor bleeds enthusiasm for the topic and for teaching. And I think the weekly office hours he holds are what he looks forward to the most at his job. It's hard not absorb some of that enthusiasm.\n\n* You know those systems design questions you get asked in job \ninterviews? This is THE class to take to get better at those. Though it makes no attempt to teach you the state of the art, just the chronology of ideas up through the recent past.\n\n* I love the test format. The questions are posted publicly, then you have the weekend to collaborate with the class, memorize your answers, and type them into an Honorlock session. This means the test questions are hard. They really make you think about design choices, and all the factors involved in a design scenario. Keep in mind, the dark side of detail orientedness (as is required to do well on the exams) is that most of the details don't matter past answering the test question."

                        "body": "This is my first OMSCS course. It's not clear to me how it has such a high\nrating in OMS Central. Prof. Kishore has a likeable personality and seems\nto care about his students. I suspect that this is the key reason for the high\nrating.\n\nAlso, I'm not sure if this course should be called \"advanced operating systems\". A more fitting name might be \"miscellaneous systems topics\".\n\n## Content\n\nThe course material itself is mediocre. Material appears to not have been\nupdated since the course's inception. This pertains to both lecture videos and\nprojects.\n\nThe lecture videos are presented in a way which is neither precise nor\nconcise. One sentence may be repeatedly stated in several different ways.\nThis is an indication that the presenter is unsure how best to present an\nidea. The result is that the audience may lose his or her attention when\nthe same idea is re-worded slightly and re-presented again and again. You\nessentially fall asleep watching the lecture videos because of this.\n\nThe curriculum includes some serisouly questionable subjects, ones that\nare not appropriate to be part of an operating systems course. Examples\ninclude Java EJB and NuPRL.\n\n## Projects\n\nThe projects' starting states have all the same bugs described by past reviews.\nThese bugs seem to get carried forward semester after semeter. It's not clear\nif it is the TA's or the professor's responsibility to fix these bugs - either\nway, these bugs aren't getting fixed for future semesters.\n\nThe projects, even though poorly maintained,  are all fairly simple and doable. As you will see, none of the project really involves working on operating systems or some component of operating systems.\n\n### Project 1 (C)\n\nProject 1 requires writing two C programs that make use of the libvirt API to\nmanage VMs. Program one dynamically allocates CPU to a set of VMs in order to\nbalance underlying physical CPU utilization. Program two dynamically allocates\nmemory to a set of VMs.\n\nThe libvirt API has a large API surface that you'll have to untangle.\n\nThis project will likely take 10 to 20 hours, depending on how far you want to\ngo on tweaking your algorithms.\n\n### Project 2 (C)\n\nThis one requires implementing a few synchronization barriers. Two for\nsynchronizing threads which share the same address space, and two more for\nsynchronizing processes that do not share the same address space. For the\nformer, you are supposed to use the openMP framework. For the latter, you are\nsupposed to the use the MPI framework.\n\nYou will do performance testing of your barriers in the Georgia Tech PACE\ncluster, which uses the PSB batch job management system. You will likely\nencounter significant problems with how to specify the PSB job specification in\na way that gets you the compute resources you need and the affinity that you\nneed, unless the courses updates the project instruction.\n\nIn the end, you write a summary to discuss performance.\n\nThis project will likely take 10 to 20 hours.\n\n### Project 3 (C++)\n\nThis project requires you to write a gRPC server which uses a thread pool you\nimplement to respond to client requests. Each response to a client request\ninvovles first querying a number of backend gRPC services, getting their\nresponses, and respond back to the client with the collective backend\nresponses. You must use the gRPC c++ async server implementation so as to avoid\nusing the gRPC c++ library's built-in thread pool.\n\nIf you haven't worked with c++ before, you will find out that all the bad\nthings you hear about c++ are true from doing this project.\n\nThis project will likely take 5 hours. If you haven't worked with c++ before, add 10 more hours for the struggle you will encounter with c++.\n\n### Project 4 (C++)\n\nThis project requires you to implement MapReduce using gRPC, with some\nrudimentary fault tolerance implemented.\n\nThis project will likely take 10 to 15 hours.\n",

Looking forward to attempt again when I'm more prepared.\n\n## Background:\nGraduated BS CS 5 years ago. This is my 2nd semester in OMSCS. Was rusty on C, working full-time as a full-stack web dev. No experience with systems programming. Took intro to OS as undergrad, but not GIOS. Took this class paired with ML4T.\n\nI have an A in ML4T and an A in this class so far (I think), but the workload is absolutely crazy... This class is like a second full-time job. After my second breakdown, I decided to withdraw and live to fight another day. Looking forward to taking it again after GIOS.\n\n## Professor:\nKishore is great. I love the energy he brings to the class. He is passionate about teaching. Really a great example of what an online class has the potential to be.\n\n## Lectures:\nVery good content, very well explained, but the videos are dense. I liked the quizzes in there.\n\n## Papers:\nRead the Xen paper for the summary assignment. Other than that, there's really no time to spend on the papers unfortunately.\n\n## Weekly 1-hour Hangouts:\nWas fun to get to know the professor and see him live, as well as the rest of the class.\n\n## Projects:\nLong, but liked working on them. Learned a lot, but it consumes any and all free time you have (and don't have) for weeks at a time. So they ended up being draining and stressful, as you start falling behind on lectures and exam preparation.\n\n## Exams:\nQuestions are given ahead of time, but somehow still hard because they are conceptual questions so you really need to know your stuff. Also I found it much harder to formulate answers and visualize concepts when there's no pictures in the questions; only a lot of new terminology, acronyms and concepts.\n\n## Tips:\nTake this as your only class. Recommend taking GIOS first. If you're rusty or new to anything taught in this class, you're going to have a rough time.",

Projects are all interesting and rewarding.  Exam questions were released at the start of the exam window which reduced the stress of studying/preparing as you can focus on the material relevant to the questions (still challenging, but undoubtedly makes this class a bit \"easier\" - which is fine by me as I do not think it impacted the amount learned).

If you can pass that class, you have the skill level for this one. \n- I'm in the Spring 2021 semester, but figure I'd write a review as registrations open for the summer semester soon.\n\n## Projects\n\n**Project 1 (40-50hrs - 3 weeks)**: Run some VMs, use the libvirt API to interface with them, adjust their vCPU and memory allocations dynamically. Going beyond VM theory and using a hypervisor API was interesting. I must've spent 20 hours tuning the memory algorithm alone though. I liked this in the beginning but hated it by the end. \n\n**Project 2 (40-50hrs - 3 weeks)**: Write 5 algorithms for synchronizing threads, processes and nodes. It was interesting learning the OMP and MPI mechanics and testing it on an actual cluster (PACE). We had to write 2 algorithms for threads and 2 for processes, so we could compare their performance. At the end of this, it was just too much work/time - I would've preferred writing 1 algorithm for each.\n\n- Side note: Using PACE sucked. The provided shell scripts to run your code on PACE was only half working. Students were left to correct this and share their own scripts. I'm surprised this wasn't tested ahead of time. I spent a hours before going to the forums and found people saying multiple lines were incorrect and all the changes that were required. At this point, I just wanted to get this over with and hated PACE. \n\n**Project 3 (10-15 hrs - 3 weeks)**: A gRPC project. This is always good to learn. The project was similar to GIOS, so I didn't learn much from it but at least it didn't take 40+ hours. \n\n**Project 4 (3 weeks)**: Haven't done it yet.\n\n## Lectures\n\nAs others have noted, the professor is a model for those teaching online. He engages students, gets laughs, and is captivating. He takes polls which is how he gives you extra credit attendance points. However, I found there is a lot of overlap between the live and recorded lectures. If you feel it adds much value/time spent, knock yourself out. I felt the lectures were too theoretical and it made watch these very unmotivating. \n\n## Exams\n\nGo through the video lectures a couple times and read/reply to posts on Piazza where people give their answers to the exam's questions that are released ahead of time. Clearly this isn't the objective but in all honesty, I just was never planning to read the papers. \n\n## Other \n\n- It feels like this course has been adjusted since the previous reviews. Sure, there are a ~40 recommended papers but I didn't read any (accept the 2 required for an assignment) - at least certainly not for the projects. But if you want to be an OS developer, knock yourself out and read the papers. \n\n- Why don't they distribute a VM? You're literally asking 500 students to setup an environment for each project. Just make a VM and save people time and yourself lots of questions on Piazza. \n\n- Although I had/have lots of frustrations with this course, the TAs were always very friendly and helpful. I could typically expect a Piazza response within 30 minutes and this would usually help solve my problem and ease my frustration. Also, the student community was very active and helpful.\n\n## Summary\n\nIf you're interested in OS, obviously this is a course you should take. If you're interested in general systems, maybe you should take it to reinforce some stuff. TBH, I regret taking it because of some of the major frustrations and time consumption with p1 and p2 and am just happy for it to be over (soon).",

The course gives a good overview of the various aspects of OS and the various solutions that have been used to tackle big problems in the space. The course expects a fair amount from you, but I think the TAs are super helpful and Kishore is a fantastic prof. The course was very reasonable esp. given covid. I come from a non-trad background with no C/C++ experience and this was my first course in the program. Got an A.\n\n## Pros\n\n* Learned a lot\n* Great resources\n* TAs are awesome\n* Kishore was great\n* Projects were interesting, taught me a lot about C/C++\n\n## Cons\n* Probably the \"mandatory\" weekly hangouts. I missed some and still got an A so no big deal. \n* Some HW assignments felt like busy work more than educational tools.\n\n## Advice\n\nYou could probably skip the papers, although that's where the bulk of the real learning/knowledge will come from. Maybe sample some of the papers that look interesting to you and read those (for your own personal enjoyment), otherwise the projects will take up most of your time. Start early on the projects, ideally the day they are released, no joke.",

I think I liked it but am mostly just glad to have escaped with a B.\n\n*If you can't create your own threadpool library in C/C++ you are going to struggle mightily with 3 of the 4 projects.*\n\nI was saved by doing four things:\n\n1) getting full marks on the second project (which was primarily graded on the writeup of an experiment, not the implementation)\n\n2) getting over 90% on both the miderm and the final (In our semester, we were provided with the actual test questions on the Friday that the test was released. If it weren't for that I would have definitely either dropped the class or gotten a C.)\n\n3) implementing project 4 without a threadpool\n\n4) getting at least 75% on everything else\n\n## My Background\n\nThis was my third course at GT. I got an A in GIOS and CN previously.\n\nI've been a software engineer for 4+ year with a background in Java and linux.\n\n## The Course\n\nThere's a seemingly endless amount of information in this course between the readings, lectures, and research necessary to complete the projects.\n\nThere is also a lot of administrative stuff always happening in Piazza - signing up for things, going to hangouts, etc. It definitely didn't feel very asynchronous.\n\nThe upside is that Prof. Kishore is incredibly engaged and interested in his students. That's very rare.\n\nThe projects are cool if you are interested in the building blocks of modern web applications. However when implementing the projects it felt like I was somehow missing the forest for the trees the entire time.\n\nThere isn't much of a curve in this class. In my semester it went:\n\n* 88+ is an A\n* 80+ is a B\n* 70+ is a C\n* 60+ is a D\n\nI think he said he rounded up, so maybe a 79.01 would have gotten a B - still not much of a curve.\n\nI guess overall it's cool to be able to now say that I've implemented a version of map-reduce, but it was a long, hard semester just for that.",

I think it was helpful having taken GIOS and HPCA before this mainly because those were my first classes using C/C++ heavily. The projects are really good and the material is great for the most part. There are some dated concepts and would have been better if the distributed systems section was a little more involved but I enjoyed it nonetheless.\n\nAs many others have said, **start all projects as soon as you can**. They ended up being much more time consuming than I first anticipated by reading the project description. And there is very little starter code like in other classes. You'll be starting from scratch on most of the projects (except for number 4 but that also is the most time consuming by far).\n\nProf Kishore is a great teacher and I love how much he's invested in students and trying to get them to succeed. It is clear that he has a passion for teaching and if I think the new Cloud Computing class he is teaching will be fantastic in large part because of him.",

And getting through the assigned papers within the semester while working full time just isn't possible (or at least very difficult). Overall, as an earlier review mentioned, this is very high level learning if you don't read most of the papers.\n- The exams focus on rote memorization more than anything else. I personally hate those kinds of exams but at least the format this semester was different which made it a lot more tolerable.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed the class mainly thanks to the projects and the material being relevant to my interests. Be sure to have a solid background in C/C++ or else I would think the course could easily take 30+ hours/week rather than the ~18 it took me. \n\n",

It led to some great discussion among the students and I got to see other sides of the questions I hadn't considered. It was an effective way of spreading the knowledge.\n- Kishore is one of the most involved professors of any class I've taken in OMSCS.\n\n## Cons\n\n- The amount of content is pretty bloated and some of it feels like it doesn't matter very much. While you can safely ignore most of the papers, I think I would have preferred that there just be less papers and lectures but make them matter more.\n- The bloat unfortunately extends to projects 1 and 2. While they are still pretty cool, they both have the fundamental problem that once you have the core concept down, they become tedious tuning exercises and the learning stops. Project 2 is especially frustrating because you run your tests on the PACE cluster and can potentially be waiting behind other students in the queue for hours before your code runs.\n\nI would say the projects took enough of my time that it was challenging to keep up with the lectures and papers. I was still playing catchup all the way up to the final.\n\nMake sure you have strong C/C++ skills, they will really help you on the projects.",

                        "body": "This course has a very high rating on OMSCentral, but now that I've taken it I think that rating must be influenced by survivorship bias. I made it through (with an A), but didn't much enjoy the experience.\n\nThere is simply too much material here. On top of the lectures, almost 50 papers, and 4 projects, the instructor holds a weekly office hour hangout you're expected to attend, and there are attendance marks. I dislike attendance marks under any circumstances (we're adults; paying to take this course), but attendance marks in an online course are particularly distasteful. In my case the hangout was scheduled during a weekly work meeting, and I was rarely able to attend.\n\nOther reviewers have praised organization of the course, but I found it highly disorganized. For example, the TAs attempted to 'correct' the syllabus after the course had started by quietly moving all the due dates up by a week. Only after we noticed and complained on Piazza did they make an announcement (and eventually reverse the decision). Likewise, they initially told us to submit paper summaries to a google sheet, but migrated to office 365 half way through the semester. Strangely, although they directed us to use the new sheet, they left the old one up, resulting in ongoing confusion.\n\n# Projects\n\nThere are 4 projects in this course. I found them interesting, but also found the project descriptions frustratingly vague. There is generally no description of what is actually required, or what will cause you to lose marks. There's no autograder or test harness provided here either, so expect to guess at what's important. I lost marks on one project for not interpreting the word 'gradual' as the TAs expected, for example. It's very frustrating to lose marks for things you could've done correctly if only the project description had been clear about what was required.\n\nIn another mark of disorganization, the projects contain bugs and other errors that have somehow gone uncorrected over the semesters.\n\n# Exams\n\nThe exams are a short answer rote memorization affair, and again frustrating vagaries abound. Your strategy here should be to vomit out every piece of information you can remember about the topic mentioned in the question, even if the question doesn't specifically ask about it. Just answering the question isn't sufficient. For example, the question may ask \"Is it possible to accomplish A using technology B\", but you'll lose marks if you don't also explain how A and B work. Expect to open a re-grade request and argue with the TAs to scrape some marks back after the exam.\n\nThe instructors do make past semester's exams available, so you can see this in action ahead of time.\n\n# Papers\n\nI gave up on trying to read all the papers, electing to focus on projects and memorize the lectures instead. It worked out ok for me, and I averaged 18 hours a week on this course anyway. YMMV.\n\n\n# Grade Cutoffs\n\nThe course is curved, which makes it hard to know where you stand as the semester draws to the close. The cutoffs for spring 2020 were:\n\n\t\tA range: 87 and above\n\t\tB range: 78 and above\n\t\tC range: 63 and above\n\t\tD range: 55 and above\n\t\tF: less than 55\n\n\nIn the end, I think the knowledge I gained form this course was worthwhile, but the design of the course made gaining that knowledge more difficult and frustrating than it needed to be.\n",

                        "body": "TLDR: A lot of content on tests, projects good.\n\nI enjoyed this course. It started off seeming very easy, but got more difficult as deadlines approached and I realized how detailed the midterm would be (and the final covers even much more). The projects were fun for me, especially the third and fourth (four total). If you have some C/C++ experience, this is a good course to get more confidence. Graduate Intro to OS was very helpful to take first.\n\nThe downside to me is the number of readings was, well, high. Somewhere around 45 papers are to be read during the semester, and most of them are foundational but also from an earlier time in computing. I enjoy newer research papers with tech I can relate to, so for me in general these were less enjoyable and more difficult to digest. Still worthwhile, I think, but more of a slog.\n\nThe midterm and final were difficult, being nearly completely composed of free-form text answers that can be easy to slip up and miss points. Also the scope of information from the papers adds to exam prep. The good news is that the paper highlights are covered in the lectures so that is where the best \"bang for the buck\" is at. Also there are previous exams with answers that are provided, so you might find that is a better approach.\n\nMy advice to you for exam prep, myself having a short attention span and some impatience for watching video lectures, is to slow down, pause, and/or rewatch the parts that you haven't understood to get the lectures right the first time. They are pretty long so rewatching them will take some time.\n\nSomething to note about the projects, unlike the other classes I've taken which use Bonnie or some other provided test harness, is that in this class you build your own (or hope someone else will share theirs). It is something to consider as this adds to the time commitment.\n\nOverall I'm glad I took this course and recommend it. Just don't slack.",

Professor is engaged during office hours. \n* 4 projects, 2 exams. 42 assigned papers (I didn't read any). \n* Projects 1 and 2 are in C, Projects 3 and 4 are in C++ (GRPC). \n* Almost no extra credit available. \n* TAs and other students are responsive on Piazza and slack. \n* Course material could have been better and updated. It felt more like a case study class into different OS technologies. First half of the class is more focused on OS concepts has overlap with GIOS. Second half is more focused on distributed systems. \n* You need about half the assigned time to complete each project so there is some downtime in between projects. Use this to catch up on lectures. \n* I took CS6200 - GIOS right before taking this class. Having some OS background/C/C++ experience helps a lot. \n\nExams\n* Exams are tough and require some detailed knowledge.  \n* Watch the lectures to prepare for the exams. **Don't bother reading the paper's for the exams!!!**\n* Practice exams from 2008 are provided and these are very helpful. Go over all of them as there are several repeat questions.\n* The exams focus on details and keywords. Use the practice exams to note down keywords needed for different questions. \n* Try to memorize as many past exam answers as you can and then just regurgitate it during the exam. \n\nProjects\n* 3 weeks given for each project but this semester, 4 weeks were given (due to an error in the initial syllabus dates). \n* Assignment instructions are a little vague and you have to figure a lot of things out on your own. Make sure to read the instructions carefully though for information on what will be tested. \n* No Bonnie!!! Makes testing much harder. Some students do provide test harnesses (but sometimes these are a bit hard to use). \n* No detailed written README's required. \n* Minimal starter code given. \n* Project 1: Memory Coordinator and CPU Scheduler - Use libvirt API to schedule virtual cpu and memory resources. Interesting project but takes some time to understand the API. Time Required: ~20-30 hours. I spent about the first 2 weeks working on the project on/off. \n* Project 2: Barrier Synchronization - Easiest project. Implement pseudocode / logic specified in barrier synchronization lectures & paper. Time Required: ~10 hours. \n* Project 3: Vendor/Client GRPC using threadpool - Create a simple grpc server-client to get product prices from a server. Most of the time spent on this project is figuring out C++ (I found C++ to be much harder to use than C!). Time required: ~20 hours. \n* Project 4: Map/Reduce GRPC - Implement map/reduce using grpc. This was the most challenging but the most enjoyable project. The hardest part of this project is learning C++ and figuring out where to start and what is required for each file. Use async server and sync server to get started - once you get your grpc comms working, it's much easier to proceed. Use the example grpc c++ client/server programs on the grpc website to get started and then modify as needed. There are a lot of implementation details to account for so use Slack/Piazza to discuss with other students. Time required: ~40-50 hours. \n",

You will be reviewing and studying random technologies, their design and implementation, and their pros and cons for distributed system design. This class at times doesn't feel like it has any sort of central theme, everything just seems to be pieced together. Students are expected to be able to regurgitate random facts from papers and lectures and points are rewarded if specific terms and definitions are used in the answer to exam questions.\n\nAfter each exam, I immediately dumped everything I learned from my brain as I most likely will never use the information I was required to memorize for this course.

                        "body": "Advanced Operating Systems is a great course providing a very broad overview of operating systems technology. It is very enjoyable, but it is very time consuming. \n\nYou must know C and C++ reasonably well to do this course. The first project is a pretty hefty project in C where you have to interact with a relatively awkward external library to manipulate virtual machine resources. This particular project also comes with no boilerplate code written for you. The last project is big C++ project. Whilst it comes with boilerplate code written for you it still isn't very easy and is time consuming. Therefore, if you haven't programmed in C AND C++ before, you will really struggle.\n\nThe course consists of:\n- 4 projects (first 2 in C, next 2 in C++; projects 1 and 4 are hard, 2 is medium, 3 is easy)\n- 2 exams (midterm and final)\n- 2 paper summaries\n- A warmup homework consisting of questions + some pthreads code (to test your readiness)\n\nAn important thing to note about this course, is that whilst it is structured around a particular set of very specific technologies and solutions in the OS space, that is not what I felt the course is really about. The real lesson is how to do systems design. The specific systems considered are just case studies (though particularly important ones). Therefore, despite the age of some of the papers that formed the basis of the material the content is still relevant, because design principles are timeless and extend beyond any particular solution. The professor emphasises this point several times throughout the lectures.\n\nHaving said that, the exams are just rote learning and they test you on the details of all the technologies and not on system design. In some way, this is nice, because if you prepare well it's easy to get really high marks. To prepare, do the past papers which are released a few weeks before each exam. My advice is to simply go through all the worked solutions and write them in your own words (even if you had to look at the answer). The worked solutions often point out which key terms must be mentioned to not lose points. Pay attention to this! The graders are encouraged to be flexible, but missing key terms will lose you points so make sure you know what they are.\n\nThe course is based on 45 papers. You are supposed to read them, but I'm pretty sure most people don't. You only need to read 2 of them (for the paper summaries, though that's only 2% of the grade). For exams, past papers and their solutions are much better preparation. However, the papers still have value, because they go into much more depth than the lectures. Here is some advice for minimising the time spent on the papers:\n- don't bother with the review questions - they require you to really understand the guts of the papers and are very time consuming\n- skip the evaluation and related work sections in the papers - the evaluations made more sense in the context of the time the papers were published\n- don't read them before the lectures which cover the same material - I recommend reading them at least one week later as revision\n\nThe one downside of the course for me was that the weekly hangouts were in the evenings of US time so I couldn't attend (1 AM in Europe). Since the professor is very active in this class I feel like I missed out on that. The recordings are made available though.",

C/C++ experience will help you a lot - I didn't have much so spent a lot of time picking C back up.\n\nProjects are relatively fun, and you will get a lot out of them. Be prepared to spend a lot of time on them. Lectures are **dense**. \n\nProfessor was amazing. Enthusiastic, readily available. Props to Kishore.\n\nLots of readings, but students write summaries as an assignment so you can read the shorthand if you'd rather not read 100+ pages of OS papers published 30 years ago. I'd not recommend you skip all of them, but this helps in a tighter week, or when studying. \n\nThis was my first course, but I've taken a few now and this is still in the top half of my favourite courses. I don't think I'd recommend as your first course unless you really want to dive in to a busy workload.",

                        "body": "I took  the course **Fall 2019**\n\n**OVERALL**: Great course, has a heavy focus on foundational distributed systems concepts, which are huge right now if you want to really understand what's going on behind Cloud and Edge Computing.\n\n**TEACHING STAFF**: Responsive and helpful.  Prof. Kishore has clearly put a lot of effort into this course.  I would like to see it continue to develop further as Cloud computing only becomes more ubiquitous.  Weekly office hours with the professor, daily office hours with the TAs if you want them via BlueJeans, therefore there is *no excuse* for not getting the help you need to succeed.\n\n**MATERIAL**:\n- Academic readings cover the breadth of computer science, from the 80s to ~2007, plus additional optional readings.\n- There is a **lot** of reading.  While you could survive and get >= B only skimming the papers, I would recommend carving out time during a morning commute or right after work to chip away at them, as the body of knowledge they want you to absorb is well chosen and will really help you strengthen your overall knowledge in OS.\n- Prior exams with solutions are released for you to study!\n- Lectures are really good (maybe not great), and deliver the needed concepts in a short and concise format.\n- **HINT**: Use your classmates paper summaries (all links are shared to the class in a spreadsheet) to quickly review the academic readings!\n- A good supplemental resource by a former student for the second part of the course, can be easier to digest then some of the lectures, is in the link below: \n- **https://www.researchgate.net/publication/299535414_Illustrated_Notes_for_Advanced_Operating_Systems/link/572bd90008ae057b0a0958c6/download**\n\n\n**PROJECTS / EXAMS**\n- Exams are fair and **not cumulative**.  They are difficult, but if you watched the lectures and study the provided resources they do a good job of testing your understanding of the course concepts.\n- Projects are 3 weeks each, and varied from 20 - 50 hours of work for me (a more experienced C/C++ coder could likely shave off 10 hours).\n- **P1**: Coding in C. Virtual Memory and CPU management.  I thought this was the MOST difficult, but a fun challenge.\n- **P2**: Coding in C. Implementing core OS algorithms.  The easiest, but still a fun exercise!\n- **P3**: Coding in C++. Distributed comms via gRPC.  Lots of fun\n- **P4**: Coding In C++.  Builds off P3 concepts, and i'll leave the rest for you to discover.  The 2nd most difficult after P1 in my opinion, but some called this the hardest\n\n**FINAL NOTES**: If you are unsure about this course, take CS_6200 Intro to Grad OS.  If you can make it through that, you'll do fine in this course.",

My current job requires a good understanding of OS concepts but despite that, I found the course hard. The projects required a good knowledge of C++ and they were long but interesting. You will need to understand he concepts well to do well in the projects. Some of them involve analysing the CPU, Mem utilization numbers closely to identify and correct environment issues if any.\n\nThe TAs were responsive but I found the need for a couple of regrade requests on the projects.\n\nThere was a lot of theory to be learned and the midterms were especially long and hard. The finals were a little better but the questions needed a good understanding of the concepts. \n\nThe grades were curved and the TAs provided a \"One Time Forgiveness\" option for resubmission of the projects after the deadline.

Though it requires a good amount of work to be done for projects and assigned readings. In fact, I am glad I did not pair it with any other course.\n\nThe course covers the OS principles, its history, and its relevance today. It\u2019s pretty interesting to know how the latest technologies of virtualization and cloud have its basis on principles from the 80s and 90s. The videos explain the topics well and have assigned papers for further readings. I must have only managed ~30-40% of those (some 40+ papers are provided at the start of the course.) The midterm and final questions are not MCQs and require some memorization as answers are to be given in bullet points/essay form. However, the previous year papers and solutions are quite helpful in understanding the pattern. From lectures and previous year papers, one tends to figure out which research papers are more important from exam point of view, though others are equally important from a learning perspective. Midterm and finals are 42% of the total grade. Grades are based on a curve.\n\nThere are 4 projects to be done and they require good C/C++ skills (C for projects 1, 2 and C++11 for projects 3, 4). Even with knowing C++ for the last 9 years, the projects were not easy. Project1 was quite difficult, with many test cases to cover and Project4 required writing a lot of boilerplate code(~40 hrs of work, 800+ lines of code). However, all the projects were interesting and offered something new to learn.\n\nProf. Kishore is a great instructor who teaches very passionately and the lectures explain the topics very well. Office hours happen once every week. I could not attend any live but videos are recorded and shared for later viewing. The TAs are also pretty responsive and helpful, I was pretty surprised that they accepted my request to reassess my midterm solution.\n\nOverall it\u2019s a great course with lots to learn (you would not be writing your own OS here if that's what you are expecting but you will learn a lot about OS principles, virtualization, distributed systems, etc.) Advise to anyone who is interested in taking this course - be prepared to work hard, DO NOT start the projects late, brush-up on C/C++ skills if you are not using it on daily basis, it would not be easy learning it on the go. And try to follow the schedule provided for watching videos, I missed the schedule after the midterm exam and I had to slog a lot towards the end.",

There are lectures about historical OS architecture at the beginning, but then it jumps into distributed system topics. So if you expect a class like where you implement a simplified version of OS functionality, this is not for you.\n\nAssignments are hard and time-consuming, so be prepare to start way before the deadline. There are 4 (+ 1 extra credit) and all in C / C++. Also you have one more ramp-up project which gives you 5 pts or so at the beginning.\nExams are certainly difficult and require too much memorization to me. The previous exams provided were very helpful but I don't think it was useful learning experience, rather it was just like studying and spend so much time purely for grades.\nAlso this class gives you so many additional papers to read, while you need to pick only 2 among them and submit your summarization. I doubt that many people read all of papers which were listed in our syllabus. \n\nDue to so heavy workload, I gave up fully absorbing some part of lectures which actually I am interested in.. my fault, but I think it'd be helpful if the class gave me more focus on them. Also I assume not everyone is interested in exploring architecture of very old systems (while the idea is still valid in this era) in a shallow but rapid way.\n\nOverall, I certainly leant some but ended up in just keeping my focus on getting grade B+. Depending on how much you can allocate your time in this class, YMMV. But I don't recommend taking this class as one of a pair with another class.",

Most of the grade came from the 4 projects:\n\n* Implement hypervisor CPU scheduler and memory manager (C)\n* Implement and improve various concurrency primitives (C)\n* Implement asynchronous server/client with gRPC (C++)\n* Implement the MapReduce framework with gRPC (C++)\n\nI disliked the first project, but thought the other three were great. Going into this class, I had some C experience but no C++ experience (but had dabbled with Rust, so I understood issues of ownership), and had no trouble picking up enough C++ to be productive. I thought the projects were interesting, useful, and appropriately scoped (re: amount of work, time allotted, etc.).\n\nThere were a lot of readings for this class - I didn't have time or energy to read everything, but I read a lot and learned a lot from those papers. This class uses the actual research papers that introduced a lot of the concepts central to distributed computing and operating system design in the '80s and beyond, so it was interesting to see how those papers had influenced the landscape of today's operating systems.\n\nThe lectures were fantastic. It's very obvious how much Prof. Kishore cares about the subject material and the students. \n\nI definitely recommend this class. It could even be a good first class, if you're feeling ambitious (though it might be wise to start with IOS first).",

The workload ramps up considerably in the last 4-6 weeks.\n\nIt's a survey course, so it covers the seminal systems research papers over the last 4 decades to the modern age. There is a lot of information here. If you read and understand every paper, as Professor Kishore recommends, this course easily hits 20+ hours/week. I started to suffer from information overload, and skipped the last 20 papers.\n\nFortunately, reading the papers isn't necessary to get a good grade. Watching the lectures and reading the prior exams is enough to do well in the midterm and finals.  I still highly recommend reading the more interesting papers though, if you can. You will learn a lot.\n\nThe projects are tough, but really good. I found them far more relevant than IOS (you use grpc for instance, not ancient rpcgen). Writing barrier algorithms was probably my favorite. On the downside, the projects are far less structured than IOS. The requirements can be a little vague, and there is no Bonnie for testing your project. You have to figure out the tests yourself, and be confident in your solution before submitting it.\n\nThere is no hand holding in this course! But it's a really great course, and my favorite in OMSCS so far.",

I had very little experience coding in C++, and I had never coded in C before. The first two projects were in C, while the last two projects were in C++. I put it in a lot of hours into this class, trying to learn C/C++ as well as trying to succeed on the projects. Because of the extra effort, I did really well on the projects.<br>\nMy favorite projects were Project 2 (C) and Project 4 (C++). For Project 2, we had to use the libvirt API to create a CPU scheduler and memory coordinator to manage virtual machines with varying resource usage. For Project 4, we had to create an implementation of the MapReduce using gRPC - this was the biggest project in the class and was also the final one. They gave us 4 weeks instead of 2 weeks to finish it, and I think I spent 3 weeks total on the project.<br>\nI found the exams to be difficult because you basically had to memorize a lot of information. This class covered several different operating systems and algorithms that were developed decades ago. Old midterms and finals were already on T-Square, so if you had to time to go through all of the old tests and skim through the research papers, then you would do fine on the tests. I definitely preferred the projects over the exams though.<br>\nThe class is curved at the end though, so as long as you start on the projects early and score really high on them, and not completely bomb the tests, you can get an A in the class."

It focuses more on distributed systems and the contributions of theoretical operating systems than the details of current, commercial operating systems.

Course grades are curved or scaled after all of the test and project grades are in.\n\nThe part of this class that I really enjoyed was the projects. I've got a moderate amount of C/C++ experience: three or four classes in recent history plus some self-study. These really stretched my skills and helped me improve my ability with these languages. The final project (MapReduce) took me about twice as long as the first project. I was able to finish the first project with about two days of solid work (8-10 hours per day) and the final project with about four days. Your experience will vary.\n\nThere's one hint I wanted to add that I didn't see below: guess on the tests. If you're not sure of the answer, then make inferences from the question, flesh out an answer from whatever dim memory you've got of the subject, etc. I did so, and was rewarded."

The amount of time you spend on projects will directly correlate with your knowledge and comfort level in C/C++.  Other than the first project your algorithms/design approach will essentially be handed to you, and the point is to either implement the logic or learn a framework.\n\nWhile you can skate by not reading the papers, this will end up hurting you in the end.  Some of the complexities of the material is glossed over in the lectures only to be exposed in the readings.  Though if you correlate the \"hot topics\" of previous midterms/finals with the papers, you'll get a good idea of what papers are more important than others.\n\nOverall this is a difficult class but certainly doable.  It's reputation of being a \"weeding out\" class is fair.  The expectations of students is also fair.

They can be time consuming, especially the latter projects. Especially if you're not familiar or comfortable working in C and a Linux (or unix-like) environment. A lot of other students seemed to struggle with the basics of settings up the environments needed to complete the projects.\n* For midterm and final definitely use previous midterms/finals as study material. Most of the questions are derivatives of previous years, or sometimes the same just worded slightly differently.\n* Read the papers! Read over every paper at least once to help gain insight into the topics discussed in the lecture videos.  And read the papers before the lecture videos.\n* Final course grade is curved. Everyone seemed to do mediocre or not-great on the final and midterm exams, but doing well on the projects and completing the rest of the assignments will help ensure a good grade out of the course.",

                        "body": "This course was very informative, but required a lot of work on the projects and especially on the assigned readings.\n\nThis course covered a lot of OS principles, both historically and relevant to today's environment. It was interesting to learn of many concepts that were \"ahead of their time\" and just now coming into mainstream given cloud and data center technologies.  \n\nThe projects were slightly harder than average difficulty and required good knowledge of C++ (in particular C++ 11). Coming from a C++/embedded background this was not too difficult, but given some of the Piazza posts many had problems in this area.  Most projects had \"multi-threaded\" attributes, so a good understanding of threads is a good thing to know coming into the class.  Nonetheless, all the projects had a high \"learning value\", introducing us to several technologies I haven't been exposed to (but expect to put into practice).\n\nThe assigned readings were also voluminous, with many of them supporting the lectures. Plan to spend countless hours reading these papers. Several details of the papers were asked on the midterm and/or final exams, so this is not an optional component of the class. Most of the papers were actually quite informative, though some went into a lot of details and performance evaluations, which could've been summarized in just a few sentences (I mostly just skimmed these sections and got the necessary information our of the summary).\n\nBy far, the most challenging aspect of the course were the midterm and final exams, which together comprised 42% of the overall grade. These tests were quite simply \"hard\". The tests did not exactly focus on the facts learned during the course, but instead on whether the student understood the concepts/facts and could make additional deductions on those facts.  The exams, while still performed in Verificent/Proctortrack were all essay type questions. Even the True/False questions required an explanation in order to get credit.  The exams were definitely comprehensive over the material.\n\nThe lectures were actually quite good. The professor took the time to convey key concepts, including examples and details. Of course, his lectures were primarily an overview with examples of the assigned readings. The TAs were quite helpful and responsive on Piazza.\n\nPerhaps the only negative (I consider the \"difficulty of the course a positive) was that the projects took a long time to be graded.  At midterm (i.e., time to withdraw), only about 30% of the grades had been posted.  This may have been caused by significant events during the early part of the semester (Hurricane Irma, Harvey and Katia) that impacted a lot of students (and in the case of Irma the Atlanta campus).  A special 1 time \"late forgiveness\" policy was however, introduced to accommodate those impacted by these storms.  I was a little disappointed in that the course did not go into more \"kernel level\"  OS details, but stayed a little higher level detailing how OS support newer technologies such as security, data centers and distributed computing systems, which seems to be more of the trend.\n\nI would definitely recommend this class to anyone interested in distributed systems. Don't be misled into believing that the course is just an advanced undergraduate OS type course. You'll learn a lot in this course, but you'll also work hard to do well and be glad you took it (after it's over).",

The content covered in the first two or three lectures was about the extent my brain could take. Thank goodness you can re-watch the videos. I filled up a spiral notebook in the first 3 weeks. \n\nAt the time I took the class the white papers were \"recommended\" reading. That should be changed to required reading and you better start reading them daily. Download all of the previous semester(s) mid-term and finals early to get a good idea of what to expect. \n\nI got a 48 on the mid-term. Ended up withdrawing from the class and was lucky to make it before the deadline somehow. A friend stayed in and ended up with a 57 and got a B! I am sure the class has good content but what a shock as to how much was flowing from the pipe. If you aren't sure about the Adv OS then take the Intro to OS. Both of them count toward the requirement.",

                        "body": "Tough course, the materials are very dense and cover a lot of topics. The topics mostly come from papers published 20-30 years ago but are still relevant (some are the foundations) of modern operating systems. \n\nProjects are interesting but require solid foundation in C/C++. You wouldn't want to spend time familiarising with C/C++ while the projects itself require significant time from design to implementation to testing. Plan to spend at least 30 hours to finish each of the project. At least one project requires you to start from scratch without any template. The good news is grading is quite lenient and often TAs forgive small mistakes or inaccuracy as long as the codes reflect your understanding of the materials. \n\nPiazza is moderately active, questions about course materials are usually answered during office hours. Prof Ramachandran is a very passionate teacher and he monitors closely the class in Piazza. \n\nThe video lectures explain most of the concepts very well, however there are a lot of details not mentioned in the lecture slides. My advice is to print the lecture slides and take notes on the details from Professor's speech. These notes will be very useful in the exam preparation. \n\nThere are tons of papers to read, most of them are the details behind the course materials while some are supplementary. I wish I had more time to spend time reading those papers, as throughout the semester I only managed to read ~30% of them. However if you watch the lectures, you should be able to do ok in exams. \n\nExams are, as others have stated, brutal. The midterm average was 58. The exams require good understanding of the course materials plus *very* good memorisation. Some questions from past exams reappear so don't forget to review them. \n\nThe grade is curved hence the grade will be relative to others'. Overall I enjoy this class and I recommend this class if you like low level stuffs and ready to spend at least 15 hours a week.",

Learning how to read academic white papers is key to passing this class. Figure out which papers are heavily emphasized and concentrate on really understanding those papers. Make sure you have a strong C background or take the time before taking this class to really learn C. C++11 is required for the last 2 projects but I was able to finish those projects without any problems with just my C background.

I didn't know what I was getting into until the classes started, but quickly I realized this was going to be tough. \n\nThere's more material in this course that what you can cover without going nuts. The lessons are long and complicated, and each one comes with a bunch of scientific papers that you need to read and understand. I found the material fascinating but reading and learning the content of the papers will probably take some getting used to. \n\nThere are two exams in this class. Both are closed notes and for each one you have to understand a ton of content. The questions are not limited to single or multiple-choice which make the exams even more complicated. My class did very poorly on both exams, and we had to wait for a generous curve to pull our grades up. \n\nI scored 57 out of 100 on the first exam and an incredible 75 in the second. These, together with solid grades on all the projects, gave me all I needed to finish with an A. Participation in the class was also a big factor, so I recommend you make yourself visible as much as you can. \n\nBy the way, be ready to code a lot. The projects were amazingly interesting and complicated, and we had to code like crazy to finish them. Any previous knowledge of C will certainly help you out here, but I although my C was very rusty, I was able to pull through after some long nights. \n\nNot everyone was lucky on these projects, and a big portion of the class wasn't able to even find the solution to some of them. I'd recommend starting as soon as you get access to the project description because you'll need every minute you can get. \n\nOn this course you don't work on teams, so your success or failure is entirely on you. That being said, make sure you collaborate with everyone else in the class. That was one of the reasons I was able to finish all the projects and end up with an excellent grade.",

Mainly had to drop because a newborn and toddler in the house made it almost impossible to get any work done. \n\nThat said, this class had a lot of required reading. Not the most interesting material to read through but it is scientific papers so be prepared to read papers several times. I think on average there were 3-4 papers per week. The first project seemed reasonable but a lot like the projects in IOS (which I took Fall 2015 and did very well in). You will fight with the autograder a lot and instructions were fairly vague. Good help from Piazza though. \n\nFrom looking ahead before I dropped there is A LOT of material you are tested on in the midterm/final study guides that comes directly from the papers. This might be the reason that the test grades are so low. \n\nI was excited to take the course but after spending just over a month in the course I'm glad I dropped it. Definitely information overload from the papers and trying to digest those left me exhausted when tackling the project. If the instructor trimmed down the readings a bit so you could focus on the lecture material and projects (where you actually learn IMHO) then this could be a good class. Until then I will not be signing up again.",

Here is a link to a grade distribution chart that showing there are very few Cs, Ds, and Fs given. http://critique. gatech. edu/prof. php?id=RAMACHANDRANUMAKISHORE#CS6210 \n\nThis was my first class and I would consider it garbage. Yes, I learned a good bit and the concepts in the projects were good. Our class avg on the midterm was a 56. 5 and the median was 57. 75. The grades on the final were mostly C's. Even with such awful grades, I would say they were very gracious in the grading. I got a 77 on the midterm and a 73 on the final, and if they had graded them correctly I would have done much worse. I flat out didn't read the papers, and only studied the videos and my notes on them. I also didn't do the paper summaries and I somehow only got 30% on the message board participation. Actually there were people who posted hundreds of times and were very helpful that only got 2/3 of the participation points. Anyways, I got an 83 unscaled and somehow got an A in the class. Anytime a teach has to scale this much and has such poor test grades, the teacher is doing a poor job. From what I've read, I don't expect other classes to be such a mess though.",

I allocated about an average of 2 hours a night. \nThe class consists of 4 projects, a midterm and a final. The course work is a mixture of lectures and academic papers. In order to do well, you must read and understand the papers, which can be long and dry depending on the topic. There are lots of papers to read. \n\nThe projects were interesting and not trivial. If you are well versed in C, then there wont be a big problem. If not, then you should probably get some practice. \n\nTips to do well, \n- Listen to the lectures\n- Read the papers\n- Take lots of notes\n- Start studying for exams at least a week in advance\n- Start the projects as soon as possible. \n- Participate in the Piazza forums",

The student views lectures, read academic papers, constructs projects, and sits for midterm and final exams (also a brief homework, two paper summaries, and forum/class participation). \n\nThe material is expansive but interesting, and the student learns about important developments in systems, including parallel and distributed systems, hardware\nimprovements, and network speed. \n\nLectures: cover important topics and explain important concepts, watching twice may help identify and understand more important topics/ideas. Professor clearly knows the material. \n\nExams: Midterm and final were humbling, vast amount of data, require precise details, previous midterms/finals available, most questions recur, focus on those topics. \n\nPapers: read (nearly) 40 papers (required and optional), plus other relevant papers; learn to efficiently read and understand academic papers and glean important content, reread important papers. \n\nProjects: require Linux (ubuntu VM), and good C programming skill;\nuserthreads - learn about user space threads, scheduling, context swaps, signals, locking;\nbarriers - learn about MPI, OpenMP distributed computing, barrier synchronization, write performance summary;\nweb caching - learn about RPC, caching (LRU, LFU, LRUMIN), measure performance, test case bias;\nreliable virtual memory - learn about transactions and log structured files. \n\nProjects take 30-60 hours each. Papers average 2. 5/week (2-4 hours each). Study for midterm and final (20-40 hours each). You will learn enough about systems work to decide whether the area interests you. I reread many papers, and watched most lectures 2-3 times. \n\nProject specifications were ambiguous, students shared tests, share the test case writing workload, typical online challenges (questions, feedback), test proctoring had problems. I took 2 days off to study for finals, and 2 other days off to work on projects.",

I spent a lot of time trying to read them all for the midterm, but didn't do as well as I'd have liked (although i was average for the class). I spent more time taking previous exams for the final and didn't read any of the papers, except to find solutions to questions, and did really well.

This takes a while because you have to commit a good deal to memory, so make sure you go through these and also all of the previous midterms and finals (which they also post on T-Square), at least a week or two in advance of the tests. \n\nFinally, to prep for the course, I would strongly advise that you brush up on your C coding. You don't need to be a guru, but make sure you have your dev environment properly set up with a decent IDE, and especially know how to debug programs. I didn't have to use valgrind for any of my projects thanks to the copious amount of unit tests that I wrote, but for the final project I did use valgrind to help me locate a bug. So it can only help to be familiar with that tool. \n\nMake sure you also participate in Piazza - those are easy points you don't want to give up ;-p\n\nGood luck to everyone!",

I spent days cramming, and re-watching the lectures. \n\nThe projects are not impossible, but are very time-consuming in order to write, debug and get to pass auto-grader, and corner-case testing, however, given enough time (2-3 weeks) you can complete them. I completed 2 of 4 with A's but they took 40+ hours to get that over 3 weeks. I am a novice C programmer, so that was my downfall. I'm sure others with a high level of C programming did them in half or less time, but they are covering subjects and APIs that we are given and forced to use, that come with no instructions, we had to fumble about them to figure out how to use them correctly. \n\nIOS will help, if you are not fluent with C. Overall this is definitely one of the harder classes in the program, BUT I did learn a lot, and I'm a better C programmer because of it. \n\nOH one more weird thing... the PIAZZA participation grade (3% overall), seems to be based on an algorithm of Days logged on, posts read, and contributions.

IOS was a good basis when you're not already familiar with C and systems programming. \nEvery lecture walks students through a single paper, explaining the concepts and adding historical, academical context. The selection of papers is very good, it's a journey through landmark ideas in systems research. Reading all the papers was impossible for me with a day job and hobbies. I resorted to reading the abstract and summaries (provided by peres as part of course requirements) for about three quarters of the material. \nThe grading of projects and exams seems fair and forgiving. \nThe projects are tough and require recognizing challenges and coming up with your own designs for them. Also you have to write your own test code, which can be a substantial part of the project. It is always recommended to start working on the project 2-3 weeks in advance to be able to ask questions on Piazza and also just to sleep over it and find solutions to problems. They are definitely not \"just doing the exercise\". \nThe course requires a bit of investment, but offers tremendous learning opportunity. I was also constantly drifting off into the subjects covered while browsing through Wikipedia, research papers and technical manuals.",

Student evaluation:\n\n* Tests - two tests that make up 46% of your final grade are brutal if you don't have an eidetic memory to remember all the content of all the papers. On the final, of 49 students participating in a pole, only 1 thought they got a 90+, 4 thought they got an 80-89 and down, with the largest group < 59. \n\n* Projects - four projects make up 48% of your final grade. The projects were challenging if you aren't a good C programmer, but not overly so. They were a bit under-specified which made it hard to know for sure you were doing things the \"right\" way. Much of our discussion on Piazza was in trying to interpret what we were supposed to do about edge case X or edge case Y. \n\nHoping for a strong curve....",

The midterm & final tests are not that useful, you'll soon forget the memorization you cramed during the tests. Also, even you understand 100% what is said in the video, unless you study the past exams, you'll not know what you need to remember in order to do well in the exam. For me, I never read the assigned paper (typical academic paper that don't get to the point, 10% of them are well written, the others are painfully boring to read), I just prepare flash card from past exam paper, spent one solid week+ to recall all the answer before the mid term and final and got A in both tests. A great 70-80% of the questions are repeated from past exam. If you can score 50%+ for the rest of the new questions (which they also give you study notes without the answer key), you can easily get a solid 80%+ score in each test and secure your A.",

If you are weak or new to C this time estimate could easily be trippled if not more. The second component is lecture and reading material. It is complicated stuff. You could easily spend 20 hours a week understanding and trying to memorize all the academic paper assignments. The two exams will quiz you on this material and you honestly need like a photographic memory of the material to do well on the exams.

They really are 'just parroting' (like Brad Cain says above) back what is in the lectures and the previous midterms that are given to us to study. Also, I think that the name of this class should be 'A History of Operating Systems'. It's really all about the innovations in OS design over the years and NONE of the operating systems that we study are still in use today. Again, REALLY great class, I enjoyed it thoroughly!",

The exams were frustrating because you basically have to memorize an absurd amount of detail and regurgitate it. You *must* be good at C or be able to pick it up quickly to do well in the class. The projects were my favorite part, and have taught me a great deal about operating systems.",

So, if you are not familiar with C, consider learning it before the class. Projects itself are interesting and challenging to solve. The time provided is fair. \nPaper: This class has a lot of papers to read, be prepared to read 15+ papers. Need to understand every detail ( check next paragraph why )\nExams: You need to memorize past exams questions and majority of detailed information available in some papers. \nTip: Start the projects as early as possible !",

However, because the midterm was brutal for me, took more time near the end to study for the final which may have not been necessary. Better safe than sorry. Undergrad was back in the mid 80s for me so needed a little ramp up time as well. I concur with Andrew Wolfe with the exception of reading hours. I required more hours for reading per week.",
