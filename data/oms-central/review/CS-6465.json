I did learn a decent amount, but the course uses outdated journalistic tools (considering we live in a tech-driven era) - feather quill pens and parchments, blotting paper, as well as typewriters. Final exam involves creating your own paperweight design using mathematical modeling for perfect weight distribution and stability. A lot of the class is just getting over the initial frustration of not understanding the tools of the trade, then getting a flimsy grasp of that \u201cje ne sais quoi\u201d of writing, holding on to that thought for dear life, and then finally hoping the curve would be up-bended (or upended?, or bent up?) at the very end.\n\nOverall, if you like Scribbling, you will most likely enjoy this course, and if you don't - this class will probably be somewhat entertaining. Win-win!\n\nMy background:\n\n25 years old, recently married (although currently in legal separation process) with two kids, finished undergrad in 2017.\n\nCoding Experience: Very little (academic experience with several languages, mostly writing LISP interpreters and C-to-Assembly code translation)\n\nWriting Experience: Moderate (4 published short-form novels, Pulitzer Prize finalist in Fiction in my sophomore year)\n\nMath Experience: Strong (completed Tensor Analysis, Algebraic Topology, and Stochastic Calculus in my first semester)",
