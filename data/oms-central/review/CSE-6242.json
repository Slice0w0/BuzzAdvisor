                        "body": "I really wanted to like this course as it covers some really important topics in the world of data science which could really set this program apart from others, but I feel it fell short. Your experience in this course may also be heavily influenced by the group you end up with for the project so make sure to get on top of that right when the course begins. \n\nSome of the material covered was awesome, such as data collection, cleaning, and integration as well as sql and scaleable computing. The course also covers data visualization which again could be a very valuable topic, however, instead of things used in the industry such as tableau, power BI, and python visualization packages, you go in depth on D3 which just felt like a huge waste of time. Additionally, the last few weeks of the course along with the last homework covers modeling topics that are taught in more depth in other courses, such as tree based models and clustering, so I didn't really understand the point of those. I felt this time could've better been used covering the more relevant data and visualization topics I mentioned previously. \n\nAnother issue is the lectures don't add value in this class and can be skipped aside from the bonus quizzes. They're very high level, only provide a short overview of the topics, and aren't connected to the assignments we're graded on. I do value that the class forces you to learn code on the fly as that's similar to what you experience in the real world, but when it comes to education, applying and reinforcing the lecture material in some way is the best way to retain and learn information, and this class falls short on that. \n\nAs for the assignments, they're definitely long and the difficulty of them depends on your background. Homeworks 1,3, and 4 are more python/sql based so how long it takes you definitely depends on your level of python proficiency. If CSE 6040 was easy for you, you probably won't struggle too much on these so YMMV here. On the other hand, homework 2, the D3 assignment was the nightmare it was expected to be, and the fact that most of us will probably never need D3 makes this even more frustrating. As others have mentioned, you can score very low on this assignment and still get an A in the course, so that may be the move for you if you don't want to devote a crazy amount of time to it. I also found coding the random forest from scratch in homework 4 difficult, but if you're comfortable with OOP and have taken ISYE 6740, you may not find it challenging.\n\nLastly, there's the project worth half your grade. As others have mentioned, it's graded pretty leniently and your experience on it really depends on how good your group is. Generally, the people who'll be the best teammates are the ones who are actively looking for groups on the first day of the course, so I recommend being active on ED from the get go to find people. If you follow all the guidelines, it's graded pretty leniently so you pretty much get out of this project what you put in. You can be ambitious and end up with a project that you can advertise in job interviews, or you can do something small and still get an A. Again, YMMV depending on the group you end up with and how complex of a project you want to go for. Just be prepared to work on it throughout the semester to meet the deadlines instead of cramming, and if you end up with a bad group, be prepared to do a lot of heavy lifting. I'm honestly mixed on how worthwhile I think the project is. On the one hand, it gives you the opportunity to really push yourself and apply some of the material covered in this class, but on the flip side, the guidelines are so open ended that you may also not get a whole lot out of it and may have to deal with some online group project chaos. \n\nThis class is so close to being great if it just makes some tweaks on how it operates, but despite how challenging and time consuming it may be for many, it's also not difficult to get an A due to the unlimited assignment submissions, lenient project grading, and bonus quiz opportunities.",

I ended up with an A despite getting D's on two or 3 of the HW's.  Lectures are useless, you and chatGPT teach yourself everything.",

Rather, they put together a bunch of technology that is relevant for data engineering/high end data scientists. \n\nIf you want to get something out of this class, when they are doing AWS/GCP/Databricks/SQL, with the extra time that you have study those 4 in deeeeep depth. Those 4 will be very relevant after you graduate. Other things they put emphasis on such as D3, final HW which is little bit of classical machine learning and a final project, DO NOT WASTE TIME ON THOSE. For classical machine learning, just take computational data analytics class (it is an awesome class BTW). \n\nAnyways, Overall this class focuses on all the wrong things and flies over the important ones. I would just spend this semester looking at the above 4 things and ignore other things. Yes you might end up with a C, but you will be much more marketable than someone who got an A and knows how to code D3. "

This course is definitely a tough one to grade.  On the one hand you will in fact come out learning a lot but all of it will be self taught. The lectures aren't useful at all. You have 4 homeworks and each one gets three weeks to be finished. This is definitely a fair amount of time, 10 hrs a week will get you to finish them by the time it's due. I HIGHLY recommend you start early on these HWs, as in the weekend they come out do at least 2 questions (the one worth the most and an easy one). Then the next weekend another 2 (the next biggest question and next easiest), and then finish with the final question (i think there was always only 5 questions.) You will see Python classes/functions here, you will see a lot of SQL (lite) here too and some are very tricky queries, you will see Pyspark, Tableau, and intros to amazon AWS and docker (which are musts in the data science world). But I'd say the main component of the course (maybe 40%) is D3, and that is awful, those questions will make you want to cry, 2 pages of code for a bar plot. 10 pages for an interactive visualization. That's undoubtedly the toughest part of the homeworks. I would recommend you pick you groups ASAP and before even thinking about the project agree you'll use it to help each other out in the hw (NOT AS IN PLAGARISM) but as in \"hey for some reason this query works locally but in gradescope i get an error, what could it be?\" or \"any good resources for this D3 part\" or \"How can I make my graphs dots change color\". Specific things like that, because a lot of the time SMALL parts of your code will be what's not letting you get full credit. Getting a good team is a must, if you feel like the group isn't helpful FIND ANOTHER GROUP. The group project is worth 50% of your grade and is the easiest part of it. Do not screw it up. A good group and good project will guarantee you at least get an 80 even if you struggle in the hws (60s/70s). I ended up getting an A in this course (actually 89.90) but it was rounded up and I bombed (40% F) one of the homework assignments (tried to do the docker/aws HW3 in one weekend, DON'T do this.)  Thanks to my groups predisposition to help each other out, we did really well on the other HWs and got an A in our final report. I'd recommend taking this course AFTER Computing for Data Analytics and also Computational Data Analysis. I took all three fall 2023 and the dataviz+CDA combo whilst working full time nearly killed me, I was very stressed out. Don't do this, but you can deff pair this with an easier course (MGT or other mandatory intro courses) whilst working (probably even two if you really want to speed rush).",

I really liked the autograder (though it was less helpful in the last assignment and a half - seems like they haven't developed as good of tests for those yet). The TA's were not very helpful in terms of answering questions, but other students were a good resource on edstem. The project is not too bad as long as you carefully follow the rubric.",

Many of the reviews here comment on how finicky the autograder is, how the TAs aren't much help (not that they could be, given the impossible chat-only interface), how the class suffers from being ocean-wide and puddle-deep. And I agree with all.\n\nWhat was the point of the class though? What was I supposed to walk away from it with? Visualization skill? I have a very vague recollection of watching videos early in the class telling me never to use a pie chart, and warning me that less ink is better. I didn't gain anything from the d3 part of the class - I never really got fundamentals of javascript settled so that entire 1.5 HW set was a disaster. Was it working with large data sets? I used Docker once I guess, and Google Cloud Computing. I'm not putting either on a resume, and I wouldn't dare tell anyone I knew how to use either.\n\nPresumably if you come from OMSCS this class is easier, as maybe you're not expected to pick js up on the fly? But it was awful for me. There have been more difficult courses in the program, but at least I had a sense of what I was working toward. Not so with this course, at all.",

Keeping this short, the coding work ends up being student versus autograder, where a well coded and visually correct submission will potentially net almost no points, but a submission that cherry picks what the autograder wants and is unintelligible to humans can get full points.  This ultimately wasn't that difficult, but felt incompatible with the course goals of creating useful visualizations. \n\nThe project is also a black hole of time, I know one of the points of requiring group work is to simulate real world conditions, but for many of us, we already do 'group work' every single day, so adding that inhibiting factor of project management versus a solo project means most of the time goes into managing the work and the people, less into the project output or learning.  I'm sure this is team and person specific, but the project portion of other classes has been where I learned the most and got to apply my skills, whereas here that time is significantly reduced while trying to get alignment on every step of the journey.\n\nOverall, I'm just disappointed as I wrap up this class.  I'm lucky that I came in with knowledge about a lot of the topics that were covered, but unlike other courses, I can't say I've learned a single thing that I can apply to my job or life outside this class.

The visualization portion of the course focused on D3 as opposed to any other visualization tool that is used by more than a handful of people. Technically there was some exposure to Tableau, but it was incredibly surface level and limited to part 1 of 6 on a single assignment.\n3. Video lectures were not relevant to assignments. The instructors/TAs outsourced instruction by posting links to external sources and YouTube videos.\n4. Each homework had multiple errors that had to be resolved by TAs prior to being able to attempt the homework. There was no incentive to start a homework early due to the litany of errors with each assignment. Having 3 weeks for a homework sounds nice, but they didn't function correctly for the first week for any of the assignments.\n5. The challenges associated with homework assignments largely focused on configuring different software packages or new tools as opposed to the actual problems.\n\nIf you enjoy group work, then having nearly 50% of your grade dedicated towards the project grade is a silver lining. If you don't like managing schedules with 4 other people across multiple time zones while also managing a full-time job, then consider the massive group project as reason #6 for this course being disappointing.\n\n",

I got an A, but it was one of the most challenging classes I've ever taken. As others have mentioned, the curriculum covers a broad range of topics, but lacks depth -- which caused me to feel constantly overwhelmed. The homework assignments are tedious and students are expected to self-educate using public resources. Students found errors in the homework and the instructions were prone to change, so you have to stay on top of discussions in the ED forum. The lectures are short video clips (around 2-3 minutes long) that introduce each topic, but don't go into enough detail. A significant portion of my time was spent just configuring and troubleshooting my environment so that it would work with Gradescope. TA's were slow to respond or didn't respond at all. I think this is understandable for a class this size, but many students didn't feel supported by staff as a result. On a positive note, I got a lot out of working with classmates in student-led study groups. I also got a really great team for the group project and grading on the group project is very lenient. To be successful in this class, my advice is to start the homework assignments as soon as they become available. Don't wait until the last minute (or even the last week) before they're due.",

                        "body": "I think this course suffers from the breadth of technology used in homework assignments. Each homework (4 in total) contains 4-6 questions, many of which will require a different platform or technology or library to be used to complete the problem. As a result, much of my time was spent figuring out how to start up and learn the (very) basics of these tools and very little time was spent actually solving the problem. I am left with scattered knowledge about the tech stack used and am disappointed that none of what I learned is enough to put on a resume (except for d3.js, but only if you also use it in the project).\n\nThe project is fine. I enjoyed how much freedom we were given because it allowed our group to do something really cool and novel. However, the assignments for the project are very rigid and it is hard to adapt a non-trivial project idea to the requirements of the deliverables. Project deadlines and homework deadlines sometimes intersect in a very stressful way. \n\nTAs are great and are active in the discussions on Ed. \n\nI would give this class a much higher rating if they concentrated the homework and gave students more focused assignments. I really feel like I'm walking away from the course having learned only what I needed to for the project. \n\nAdvice for those taking the course in the future: set a 15 hour limit to how long you will spend on a homework assignment and do not work on it after reaching that point. It's not worth it (in either grade points or knowledge gained) to work longer than than that, and your time is better spent on doing project work."

For background I have a masters in MechE and used to do plotting and charting as my day job (using ancient proprietary aerospace tools). I was hoping to use some modern libraries like Plotly or at least get some cool graduate level info on making good charts.\n\nThe idea of getting to use stuff like AWS/GC and create some really cool visuals was appealing. However the execution in this course leaves so much to be desired. \n\nOn the cloud computing side it's essentially a bunch of redundant hellow world style assignments. We end up doing stuff across DataBricks, AWS, GC, and Azure. GC and AWS have so many features that are replciated by those other ones it ends up being super redundant. Would be better if they just picked two like Databrick and AWS or GC, espcially since AWS and GC are very similar.\n\nThere is python programming in this course but is extremely surface level. SciKit is an increible libray but the usage of it ends up being plug in chug. No plots, barely caring about the data results.\n\nThe D3 focus worked out for me because it kicked my butt into learning some JS but it seems like the goal during that segment of the class was to learn how to make good visuals. Changing the D3 assignment to a peer graded assignment using something like plotly (or a short list of recommneded libraries) would be a much better approach. It doesn't create any teaching burden because the lesson we were given for D3 were about 15min and a book that was two versions of D3 old and not up to date enough.\n\nI was really hoping this course would be a BD4H lite with more emphasis on visuals. The course fails on all learning outcomes I feel and should be skipped. ",

Bad communication of findings results in uninformed decisonmaking, regardless of how good your analysis was.\n\nReview: Honestly, this is one of the worst classes in the OMSA program, a fact that is particularly egregious considering it is one of four classes that *every student in the program must take*. I came into this really excited to learn about visualization and thinking that it couldn't possibly be as bad as the reviews on here said, and walked away feeling that it was substantially worse. The course is a mile wide and an inch deep. Moreover, two core elements of the class demonstrate just how little this class is focused on actually teaching you anything: First, the instructors refuse to release any guidance, feedback, or corrections on homework assignments. Thus, if you don't manage to figure out some part of an assignment on your own (which I guarantee will be the case for SOME element of EVERY homework), too bad, guess you just don't get to learn how to do that from this class. Second, the final project accounts for 50% of the grade, but because you don't learn anything in the homeworks and lectures, you end up building it using techniques and tools that are not taught in the class at all, but that you came into the class already knowing. I got a B in the course despite bombing all of the homeworks except the first one (particularly #2 on D3) and creating a half-assed final project with my teammates that did not use any of the techniques we had been \"taught\" in the course.\n\nOther reviewers have mentioned that an important part of working in data analytics is the ability to pick up new skills, languages, and techniques on the fly, and that this requires a facility with self-instruction. These reviewers thus praise this class for helping reinforce this ability. While this observation is undoubtedly true, it completely ignores the fact that we are in this program, paying Georgia Tech to teach us new skills. If we wanted to be fully self-instructed, I would just work on my own projects and watch YouTube videos to learn new techniques.",

I spent an average of 20-30 hrs per hw and 50 hrs on hw2 alone. \n- Project is graded very generously and is worth 50%, Pick a good group of responsible teammates. I had a B average on hws, but got a 99 on the final and ended up with an A in the class.\n\n1 lie:\n- lectures are helpful (not). Biggest takeaway and skill to learn coming out of this class is the ability to self-teach a new syntax quickly. I would suggest getting really good at using stack exchange, reading articles on algorithms, and youtubing. \n\nOverall, this class was more breadth and less depth. I wish I had more time to get to know each topic a little more instead of scrambling to learn 3 new languages per hw. Grading was also a lot more lenient than I expected and there are plenty of bonus points given. Don't procrastinate and pick a good project group and you should be fine. ",

HOWEVER, if you're an aspiring data analyst/scientist, being able to learn new technologies on the fly is an essential skill. I found that this class helped pad my resume with new skills such as javascript (D3) and cloud services (AWS, GCP). \n\nMy team was able to score a 100 on all project deliverables although none of us were particularly skilled in any of the tech stack we used. The key to scoring well on the project is \"selling\" it- you don't have to make a production-ready, super-innovative web app or algorithm. Just be able to have a story as to why your solution solves a problem. The graders will be lax if you're able to do this!! The average score for all project deliverables for Fall 2022 was around 95-100.\n\nThere is AMPLE extra credit available, both on the homeworks and through bonus quizzes, and CIOS bonus (abut 5 course points total). This allowed me to flop on one homework and still come out of the course with a 95. I would recommend stressing less on the homework and instead focusing on the project.\n\nIt may be intimidating in the beginnign of the course with people flashing their tech skills trying to find competent teammates, but if you want to find a chill group, there are also people looking for that!\n\n",

The final grading is split almost 50/50 between HW and the project (no tests) and you should expect to sped a large amount of time on each of the four HW assignments.  The course doesn't offer any kind of solutions for the HW assignments so if there was a part you didn't understand that's just the way it's going to stay. I took an L on the second HW (got a 60%) and I think i'll still finish pretty close to an A.   \n\nIf they would offer some solutions for the HW, it would greatly improve the experience.

To learn D3, you need hands on experience, no lecture is needed. On the other hand, the lectures are full of knowledge and insights, by the end of the semester you will have such a diverse tools you know you can use to analyze data, that it is not feasible to test you on that.\n\n2. \"I was unlucky with the group I was assigned to\": You are all completely missing the point. As an experienced dev, I guaranty that what makes a good programmer is ABSOLUTELY NOT how efficient he can code, but rather how well he can collaborate with other people. \"You go to war with the army you have, not the army you might want or wish to have...\" And by the way: even if you got unlucky, the grading is lenient. \n\n3. D3 assignment: This is the hardest part of the course. This was my first experience doing web dev, and it took me a lot of time. I actually agree that D3 is hard to use, but I wouldn't say it is completely useless tool, there could be some niche use for that, and it was nice knowing I have this tool and having some JS experience.\n\nOverall, this course is great since you learn a TON of tools to analyze data and it is well defined what you need to do to pass the course. I can understand why people give such reviews since the structure of the course is unique, but I loved it. \n\nDo the HW ahead of time, collaborate well with your team, and enjoy watching the lectures without stressing about an exam.\n\nHighly recommended.",

If introducing JS into the class was a goal then it could have been much more fruitful to create some kind of dashboard with React.\n\nGradescope is the worst part of the class. You may find yourself finishing a whole assignment that meets the written requirement flawlessly in 3 hours and spend the next 30 hours figuring out why Gradescope says otherwise. I could imagine lots of people's (TAs, Profs, etc) hard work was put into building auto-grade modules like this but comparing to my previous Gradescope experience (ML4T), this one has been consistently worse. However, they provide some additional opportunities to make up the points and etc, so it kind of evens out I guess. Grading is definitely very generous.\n\nAs others said, instead of exploring tens of different data platforms, I wish they just picked one topic (preferably cloud data engineering) and structured it as capstone project. Overall it's not a bad class but not at its full potential yet.\n",

There is no reason you can't learn the same information in the same period of time from the internet for free.\n- Homeworks are just low impact busy work. \n- HW2 in D3 is the hardest for most people. The homeworks are otherwise easy, but time consuming. Why they think data scientists need to learn D3 is beyond me. No one in their right mind in industry is going to spend that much effort on a bar chart when they can produce everything in Python or R, or even Tableau or Power BI, especially since many companies get Power BI and/or Tableau bundled with other things. It's an egregious waste of time. High effort, low reward.\n- The information given in lectures isn't even as deep as a decent YouTube tutorial. You can go the whole class and not watch them. You only need to skim them to take the quizzes. \n- The auto-grader can be a pain. But you quickly learn that you actually only need to accumulate points from the auto-grader, and nothing else really matters. So get the points and move on with your life. Figuring out why something doesn't pass the autograder can be frustrating. TAs at least are helpful with that, but not much else.\n- TAs aren't very helpful in this course. Not compared to other courses....\n- Make sure you have a good project team and an interesting project. There are lots of deliverables for the project. But it's highly doable.\n\nI this were my first course taken in the program, I would have dropped it and went to another. This is like an undergrad course loaded with busy work to justify it as a grad course. You'll learn more from YouTube and save money.",

For reference, it was my 7th class in OMSA and I have no programming experience before starting this program. During the semester, I felt that I was only actively in class for maybe half of the time. If you have moderate to advanced Python programming skills (which you likely do if you take this later in the OMSA degree), then it is not particularly challenging. Assignments are primarily busy work and most can be completed in a single week/weekend. Since assignments are on three-week timelines, you will then have nothing to do for two weeks. The project is also due one or two week before the end of the semester, so there is generally a lot of time during the semester where you won't actively be doing anything. \n\nA couple notes on the project - Get a good team for the project and understand that the project grading is quite lenient. Pick an achievable topic and limit your scope to that specified in the project description. Also, the midterm deliverable for the project is ~60% of the final report, so if you just follow the schedule for the project and reporting, its a very reasonable workload.\n\nOverall, my opinion of the class is neutral. I don't feel that the coursework does a good job teaching you much that you shouldn't already know by this point in the program. However, really anything to keep my coding sharp is helpful. If you are a strong programmer, then I think it is safe to pair this with another course. ",

No JS or D3 experience. I will be receiving an A (94%), but only because I left some parts of each homework blank - the juice wasn't worth the squeeze. Working full-time and did just this one class this semester.\n\nThe Bad: Homeworks were time-consuming, lectures were not useful to course completion, and the Piazza was a mess (although the TAs really tried). Expect to google and ask peers for help a lot.\n\nThe Good: Exposure (and learning) of A TON of industry standard software, interesting and varied homework problems. All parts of the project are very leniently graded, as long as your group can write decently well.\n\nProject: I lucked out and had a pretty communicative and knowledgeable group. If you're an early OMSA student, I'd recommend finding one or two folks with machine learning experience to help build the your algorithm. The data viz portion we did in Tableau and that was easy.\n\nOverall this course did consume a lot of my time via the Homeworks, but that's because I'm newer to Python and Javascript. One groupmate (OMSCS) finished each homework over one weekend, but it took me (OMSA) the full 3 weeks. I enjoyed tinkering with the many different tools that were provided by this course, and believe that putting on my resume helped me land m first data scientist job. It's a wide breadth but no depth sort of class."

You are better off watching googling the topics and reading them yourself.\nBackground : Rudimentary Python and SQL\n\nWhat I liked about this course: \n- You learn a lot of new skills\n\nWhat I did not like about this course:\n- The lectures were not useful at all. \n- Group Project: I am an OMSCS student and this was my 4th course. I formed a group with 3 other OMSA students who are have finished at least 75% of their program. During the course of the group project, I collaborated with them. I listened their ideas and I helped create a design plan even though they ultimately went with a project idea that I didn't really want to do. I wrote almost all of the proposal and progress report. I coded over 90% of the project. I understood my teammates may be a bit new to Python. But the excuse was a little lame... they said \"You're from OMSCS so you're better. That's why you're doing most of the work\". The code my teammates produced were riddled with bugs and needed to be optimized in terms of speed and memory. I helped them do that. Anyways, towards the end, my teammates became increasingly disrespectful. From talking to me in a condescending tone to pressuring me to help them even though I told them I had a long day at work.  At this point, it looked like I would be creating the poster and writing the final report on my own. I was fed up with how they were treating me and having to do all of the work, so I reached out to the professor and TA. The TA shared my email with the other teammates and asked for their feedback. He did not forward their feedback to me. Anyways, these teammates then told the professor a bunch of lies about how they worked on the project and that I wouldn't take their ideas. The professor sent out an email and basically said he thinks everyone did their part so he gave them credit in the end. I never got an apology or a proper thank you from my teammates. \n\nI would not recommend this course to anyone. The course is poorly planned out, there is no guidance at all. The professor does not care if all teammates contributed equally. If you want to learn DVA, just download the syllabus and research the topics by yourself. Create a project and post it on Medium or Github. If you do take this course, I wish you the best of luck with your teammates. If they are freeloaders, let the instructors know early. ",

                        "body": "I'm OMSA and have limited programming experience beyond python and R, mostly just what I've gained through other classes in this program. If you have a ton of experience and know what you're doing, great, this class probably won't be that hard. If you're like me, this is the worst class I've taken in the program (it's my 10th).\n\nThere is essentially no attempt made to teach anything. They give you assignments, maybe they gesture at some tutorials, and expect you to figure it out yourself. You will spend hours trying to do the most basic things and for the most part it'll feel like a giant waste of time. TAs will help with some debugging, but if you can't figure some things out, you're most likely just out of luck.\n\nThe only \"teaching\" function they take on is providing and grading assignments. The lectures are a complete waste of time. I have no idea why I'm paying tuition to teach myself using resources completely independent of this course and program. What really drives home that this class isn't about learning but instead just processing students through, is that they don't provide solutions. So, if you can't figure something out on your own, you'll just never know and never learn. I assume it's so that they can change assignments only minimally semester to semester without worrying about solutions circulating out there. To me, that's prioritizing the course being lazy over providing a quality learning experience.\n\nFortunately, the third and fourth assignments aren't anywhere near as painful as the first two - in particular the second assignment. As suggested in other reviews, read the D3 book ahead of time if you can as it'll make your life easier once the course starts. Don't be afraid to try and game the grader - in some cases if you can't get things to work properly dynamically, you can figure out the specific case(s) the grader is checking and hard code the solution. I think I spent 30-40 hours each on the first two assignments (if you include time spent reading the D3 book). Then probably <20 hours each on the subsequent assignments.\n\nThe project can be a bit of a cluster. I had multiple team members withdraw from the class and consequently drop from our team the week leading up to the first project deliverable. We've cobbled something together for the final deliverable, but have no idea how it'll be graded.",

Immense breadth, not a lot of depth. Interviewer asks \"do you know ___\" or \"have you ever worked with __\". This class will add 15 technologies to your repertoire.\n\nDifficulty:\nThis class is one of the easiest ones I've taken, not to mention among ones that are required for the ML track. Homeworks are not challenging if you're good at programming. Some JavaScript, some SQL, and a good amount of python. Easy. If you know how to code and have any experience with SQL, or better yet, have taken 6400, you're all set to ride along.\n\nGroup project involves talking and collaborating with people tho, which we all know is draining by itself (I'm looking at you, nerd). But there are no tests whatsoever, and lectures are so short, so that makes up for it. Group project requirements can be satisfied with some trivial sklearn prediction, even if it's not that accurate.\n\nI finished the class with a +100, something i cannot say about other classes (cough cough ML and RL). After all, there are no surprises, you submit the hw as many times as you can until you get 100. ",

(Luckily, I had a decent group to work with resulting in A)\nYou along with your group choose what to work on in the group project from scratch.\nThey have taken extra steps to autograde all HWs so that the scores that you see in Gradescope are most likely final, which is great! (their claim is that they are unaware of any other attempt to autograde D3 assignments)\n\nTAs are very reasonable both while grading HWs as well as group project.\nTAs are assigned to group project based on the domain you choose, for e.g., we choose to work in pharma domain and our TA had a MD in Medicine and was a data scientist in healthcare domain.\nWhen students found some issues with the autograder for one of the HWs, TAs announced that 100% of points will be provided for 80% autograded score (and for 100% autograded score, they awarded bonus points!)\n\nOverall, I highly recommend this as one of the electives for anyone interested in ML specialization."

I  actually applied those concepts in the project.\n\n\nHW3 PySpark/Scala: Medium difficulty, this was one of the more fun assignments we had. You actually get to use real big datasets on AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure.\n\n\nHW4 Random Forests: I found this to be more of a filler assignment because I have used and applied the technique multiple times in the past in other courses and my profession.\n\nOne thing about the assignments though, they are VERY verbose. Each assignment had 3-5 questions, but the pdf for them was 15-30 pages. The wordy nature did provide some guidance, but I think when you start the assignment, it seems daunting.\n\n\n\nGroup Project: I liked that the project is worth half your grade, and throughout the term you have to send proposals, and project status reports (also graded) which force you to stay on top of it. As far as the grading is concerned, if you submit a report that shows some innovation from an analysis perspective, and application of visualization concepts, you will be fine.\n\n\nThe lectures provide a good overview of the concepts and they really help with the bonus quizzes, but you need to go way beyond the videos to complete the assignments. \nOverall, I liked this class. Being picky about axis ticks, and titles did get a little tedious especially since Gradescope is unforgiving about those details, it showed the importance of visualizations when trying to tell a data heavy story.\n",

No exams or silly memorization, which is fitting since analytics and data visualization are \"hands-on\" topics.\n2. Assignments do have their problems, read my course Cons below, but they do provide good hands-on experience with various visualization tools (D3.js, Tableau, etc.) and computation platforms. If you want practical experience with visualization and computation, this is a great course.\n3. A subset of the TAs are courteous, patient, and helpful. They make the course more pleasant and provide positive examples of what TAs should be.\n4. As long as you get into a great team early in the semester, don't sweat the group project. Rather, keep an open mind about how working with a smart, diverse, team throughout the semester can enhance your course experience and take-aways. I typically despise group projects, but was fortunate to have made it into a great group. I remain thankful for my group's hard work and different viewpoints provided throughout the semester.\n \n\n\n#### Cons\n1. The group project can turn into a problem if teammates don't pull their weight, or make commitments they don't deliver on. Be honest and open about tracking each member's contributions, and don't hesitate to speak up within the team, and eventually to instructors, if some team members are just along for the ride.\n2. The assignments need improvement. Some of the requirement documents are indeed cumbersome to read through or don't do such a good job steering you away from needless time sinks. On one assignment I found I was losing points due to what otherwise appeared to be a benign data type conversion. Piazza had similar posts from other students on the same assignment. Other assignments had considerable issues wrt how the auto-grader was implemented. And it's not that the auto grader itself is bad, it's how the automated tests and condition checking was setup; this is something TAs state they're still improving for future semesters.\n3. Some of the TAs are noticeably condescending, or don't hesitate to suggest or imply how silly they think some questions are.",

Myself and my project group are expected to get high A grades.\n\n**Review**\n\nIncredibly poor class structure. The class seemed to be an exercise in assigning rote, administrative tasks rather than an educational enterprise. \n\nThe 4 homework assignments consisted of 10-50(!) pages of instructions that somehow introduced more ambiguity into the process, leading to multiple Piazza clarifications, these were necessary because points could be (and were) deducted over tiny aesthetic infractions. \n\nLecture videos bore no resemblance to the assignments, and so are not worth watching, nor is their much inclination to do so after following all the details of each homework. When I would tune in, it was like an entirely separate class.  \n\nThe actual work itself is about where you would want it to be for an upper-level graduate programming class. I have strong Python experience so did not have tremendous trouble with HWs 1, 3 and 4. HW2, the D3.js assignment, was a struggle for me as I had severely limited front-end experience, I got through it with enough time, despite autograder issues. \n\nAutograder issues persisted throughout the entire class, all 4 homeworks had at least one major issue with the autograder, to the point that HW2 was curved upwards to compensate (submit 4/5 questions for 100% or 5/5 for extra credit). Combined with the seemingly never ending instructions this made for a frustrating experience. \n\nTAs were sometimes helpful, mostly not, clearly sometimes without answers but not wanting to admit it. This contributed to a lack of trust between students and TAs, it made it difficult to tell whether an error you saw was due to your own misunderstanding or autograder issues, with TAs obviously trying to answer as ambiguously as possible. \n\nThe group project guide is over 6,200 words long. Full of asides and specific file formatting instructions to follow. The project itself is as hard as you make it, our group built a Flask web app and were successful in delivery and execution, but a much a simpler project would also have met all the marks just fine. Again most of the challenge was following detailed, but largely unnecessary, instructions to the letter.\n\nIf this class were rebuilt from scratch and trimmed down severely, it might even be a good class. As of now, that is not the case. \n\nIf you're in OMSA, you have to take this class so the best you can do is form a solid project group as early as possible, brush up on D3 and grit your teeth and get through it. You won't learn a thing but that doesn't appear to be the goal of this class anyhow. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The most difficult parts of the course were D3, as I have little front end experience and the HW felt like being thrown into the deep end (although the recommended textbook was an excellent resource and really made the HW manageable), and the tedium of the group project. \n\nDigging into the group project, it was my least favorite part of the course. I'd probably recommend taking this course later on in your course load since the project is extremely open ended and 95% of what I applied to the project was from material outside of this class. My team was nice and our project was decent, but the project deliverables were so arbitrarily complex (e.g. answer these 11 questions + cover a 12 citation literature survey in a 2 minute presentation) and stressful that it really ruined the project for me. Towards the end I checked out, since the grading was very lenient, I was doing well in the course, and I didn't have much patience left.\n\nIn terms of the content covered in the course, I thought it was all over the place? I didn't really see a theme between everything covered- I think focusing on fewer topics and going into more depth would be beneficial. Also, there isn't that much of an emphasis on visualizations in this course; we covered a little bit of tableau and D3 in HW2, but that's it, really? Everything else felt very surface level and I don't know how much I'll actually remember. Overall, I did enjoy the homeworks, although HW3 felt very repetitive.\n\nI think it would be beneficial to focus more on visualizations (more time spent on tableau, seaborn, matplotlib, etc) and refine the scope of the course; I left it feeling like I know a little bit of a lot of different, somewhat related things, but nothing in much depth.",

                        "body": "The class is difficult, no doubt. The challenges are that, first, homeworks take time. Writing the code is one aspect, debugging is another. However, even with limited coding experience, I found the coding part similar to how I did things in real world - lots of frustration only to find out I forgot a comma somewhere. I reached out to the TAs with a question on my code a couple of times and they were helpful. The only thing I found poorly executed was HW 4 - Q2, not enough instructions. I ended up not being able to do some other questions as well but not because of a lack of instructions but because of my skills. Second, the group project is hard. The usual group work dynamics apply - you have to be patient with others, you have to depend on work of others (which you may not always agree with), things usually get done the night before or of when something is due, people don't always put adequate amount of effort...come prepared that this is a possibility in this course, frustrating - yes, manageable - absolutely. \nThere are a lot of small details on the group project that at some point become frustrating to students, especially at the end when you just want the semester to be over - naming files in a certain way, writing abstracts in an academic style, breaking down sections in a very publication style way. This is frustrating, I get it. However, if you come out of this class with at least some resemblence of a deliverable, and you are someone who has not been an analyst/data scientist/developer before, you have a portfolio that you can talk about in front of employers. Coupled with your practicum - that's 2 deliverables you can talk about instead of just textbook formulas. That's the point of this class as frustrating as it is. To the people who are venting below - relax, may not be the best class but it serves a purpose and not everyone is going to like it. If you get below A - who cares, a few years from now, you're not even going to remember it. The fact the professor is not engaged in this class is true, though unfortunately it is not a unique problem to this class. Very few of my other 9 classes in this program had a fully engaged professor. ",

Why did I just pay $1k for this crap?\n\n## Comments about your effort (eg., - was the expected and expended effort appropriate for this course?).\n\nAbsolutely not appropriate. The homeworks assess if you are an expert-level user of each of the technologies surveyed. If you are teaching a survey course, you should not expect students to acquire expert level knowledge. In no business in the world are you expected to learn a brand new technology and deliver an extremely high-quality product in only 3 weeks.\n\nIn addition, it is ridiculous that a product can be absolutely perfect and fail to pass an autograder. I'm not just talking about D3 - My python workbooks, in environments set up specifically for HW3 (the environments you and your staff set up), were working perfectly and outputting exactly what was necessary, and the autograder failed to run my code. Unbelievably disorganized. I spent more time on HW3 getting my correct results to pass the auto grader than actually doing the work.\n\n## What were the best features of the course, such as lectures, activities, assignments, and projects?\n\nWorking with a group cross functionally was great. We assembled a team that had a variety of skillsets.\n\n## How could this course be improved?\n\nI swear to god the directions for the project are longer than the maximum length for any deliverable. We were docked points for not having enough detail when we literally could not fit any more detail in because of the extremely low maximum page requirements. I understand the need to be brief when presenting to executives, but executives will never ask anywhere near the amount of detail required by the directions.\n\nDirections for project and homework often contradicted themselves. TA posts on Piazza contradicted the project instructions and posts from other TAs. Polo rarely if ever participated.\n\n## What was the greatest strength of this instructor?\n\nBeing smart\n\n## How can instruction be improved?\n\nParticipate in discussions\n\nActually teach the material that is being asked in homeworks\n\nClarity and brevity of instructions\n\nClarifying things when TAs post contradictory answers\n\nStaying engaged at all\n\nAll of the lectures were just Polo talking about how smart he is and how great his accomplishments have been. Instead of me paying $1k to watch you flex on everyone, maybe think about actually instructing your course.",

                        "body": "I was looking forward to a data visualization course but feel disappointed here. The teaching felt minimal and TA's seemed over-worked. Information is scattered across multiple platforms (Piazza, syllabus, project website, homework instructions, homework skeleton code, etc.) where parts of instructions can be found in multiple places making it difficult to piece together at times. Overall the course felt like it was trying to touch on too many various \"data\" topics, rather than focusing on data with \"visualization\".\n\nThe course was structured as 50% homework and 50% group project. The homework was divided up across 4 assignments, all mostly auto-graded. I expected most of the homework to be devoted to visualization techniques but I'd say only about a third of the homework actually was (if that). Some of it felt like CSE6040-part 2. One homework assignment was on how to handle big data - which seemed like the actual topic of interest for the professor rather than visualizations. The non-visualization assignments were hard for me to get motivated for. The coding was frequently more annoying than \"hard\" as you have to try to guess what the autograder is looking for (your answer could look right but it'll fail for a DOM structured differently or sometimes for silly reasons like the size of your dot was supposed to start at 3mm, not 5mm, before enlarging to 9mm, not 7.5mm, with mouseover...).\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed the visualization portions and wish there could have been more of that. Would be even better if they update the lectures to teach the techniques on the homework rather than having students find lessons elsewhere. I do not feel like my coding in Python is any better and I'm frustrated it was so much of this class when it seems unrelated to what I expected. I do feel appreciative of the exposure to Azure, Tableau, Google Cloud, AWS, and d3.js. Wish the class would have covered Shiny as well and other options in data visualization."

Not ideal if you're not coming from a CS background, but I have definitely learned a lot. You'll have a somewhat easier time if you come from a CS background. In some cases I'm certain my code was ugly and/or inefficient, but no HW solutions are released so you can't really learn best practices. TAs don't give much guidance and I feel like a lot of Piazza responses from TAs are after someone has requested input and then later the TA responds and says, \"Well, it looks like you got it figured out,\" or \"It works for me, so keep trying.\" Helpful. If you miss something in the syllabus or on the website and ask about it, responses can be unprofessional and rude. \n\nOne good or bad thing depending on how you look at it is that things are auto-graded via Gradescope, so you can have your visualization working and still lose points if it's not showing up exactly how the autograder wants to see it. \n\nThe project requires academic literature reviews, posters, and portions of it aren't worthwhile. Doing a visualization project and a group project is fine, but all the other mess seems extremely out of touch with why people are probably pursuing a degree. A large group project can also be challenging as that portion of the class is no longer asynchronous when you meet, and everyone is spending a lot of time on the HW so it's hard to focus on the project as well. Especially when parts of it don't seem valuable. \n\nVideos aren't very helpful and mostly discuss concepts. If not for the few small bonus quizzes (the structure of which is silly), there wouldn't be much reason to watch the videos. \n\nOverall, if you work at it you will learn a lot in this class. You'll learn it on your own and it will be a bad experience and you won't learn best practices, but you will learn a lot... if you're able to retain it all. Too much is covered in a single class, and the class should be broken up and redone so some teaching can actually occur and so topics can be covered with the depth they deserve. If you don't have to take this class, I would recommend against it. ",

If you aren't confident in Python then HW1 and 4 will definitely take up a lot of time. If you scored highly in the CSE6040 exams you will likely be ok\n\nI didn't watch any of the lecture videos and from what I gather from others there's no need. Does make you think what we're paying so much money for though?\n\nThere's no getting around that HW2 is a beast and easily took me more time than the other 3 HWs combined, I had never coded in D3 before and would recommend watching some tutorials to soften the blow beforehand\n\nHW3 was the best HW, getting a whistle stop tour of GCP, Databricks and AWS  while getting to use (Py)Spark was great because these are super relevant in industry\n\nIf you'd like to practice Spark before the class you can set up a free Databricks Community account where you get assigned a small free cluster with Python and Spark preinstalled which you can play with, very useful.\n\nHW4 involved coding up a Random Forest which was tricky, but there are a million blog posts out there that have done it before which can help\n\nThe project is as difficult as you make it. DO NOT overcomplicate things or you will end up not submitting for some parts. Every part of the project averaged 90%+ across the class, so just having a reasonable submission will likely get you most of the marks.\n\nOur project consisted of an Excel spreadsheet, a small notebook and a tableau dashboard and we scored 100% with a comparatively small amount of effort to the projects I peer-reviewed. Having a simple project idea which solves a problem and you can talk about (there is A LOT of writing) is more important than having some super advanced ML model. The extra time saved on the project complexity also gives you more time to finish the HWs!\n\nHowever the most important part is having teammates that **pull their weight** irrespective of their technical skills. I see a lot of recommendations to form a team early, which I agree with, not because you need a diverse set of skills but forming a team early means you are more likely to have an organised, competent team. My team (all OMSA) were great even though half were in Europe and half in the States, we assigned a project manager early which helped with the flow of team meetings and everybody did their tasks on time\n\nOverall I wish I'd paired this with a lighter course and if you are confident in your Python skills I would recommend you do this too. I scored 100% overall and (aside from HW2) didn't really feel stressed ",

It's good to expose us to many tools and platforms, but the limitation of packages to use when doing homework is killing me. I have so many ways to approach the goal but I can't use them because they are not in the package/version this course allows. \n\nWhile many of the things are useful in future, there are also something that took the most of time and effort, but it's totally not useful for many of us in our career - D3. \n\nBesides the coding, nothing hard. The logic and stat behind each hw and project are fairly easy. (I have math/stat background, little programming experience, coding does take time for me. Not recommend this course to coding beginners as debugging will take forever and there are 4 hws and 1 project, so lots of coding.)\n\nAs of the project, be prepared for anything, recall the pleasant and not so pleasant teamwork experiences in college.

I took Simulation at the same time and my DVA project group thought I was crazy. \n\nFinal take: not as bad as expected. \n\nThe workload was on the higher end especially for HW2, and it did take some juggling priorities to manage in combination with Sim. However, I've definitely taken harder classes in the program like CDA (ML) and TSA. I did take a JS course and a D3 course over the break and that helped. I also got introduced to my project team through a classmate from a previous class and the team was great. Having a good project team definitely eliminated a lot of stress.\n\nDVA is really a survey course that exposes you to a lot of different topics but with little depth. D3 is kind of cool, but I'll probably never use that. Using GCP, AWS, and Databricks in the same assignment was interesting because you quickly saw the similarities and differences. Much of the other information like clustering, classification, graph analytics, ensemble methods, text analytics, etc. I'd done in other courses, so that was repetitive. I can imagine that if coding is not your strong suit and you're not used to bouncing around between languages, DVA would be difficult. Taking the class toward the end of my coursework probably helped, since I was already familiar with many of the concepts.\n\nI thought the grading was fairly generous despite the pedantic reputation of the class. With bonus points, I made 100+ in this class, despite making a 70-something on one portion of the project. Also, there are no tests other than bonus quizzes which is nice.\n\nAre there better classes? Yes. Are there harder classes? Yes. This will not be your favorite class, but mentally prepare for the workload and you'll be fine."

In the spirit of not repeating everything that's been said before, I'll try to summarize in reference to prior reviews.\n\nThe Good\n- You will learn JavaScript and D3 very quickly. I didn't know any HTML, CSS or JS and this was a fantastic way for me to get some understanding very quickly.\n- You will get the gist of Spark, so you can be conversational in it\n- Homeworks overall do make you think and work for the points\n- TAs worked hard to clear up confusion on the homeworks and address pain points\n\nThe Bad\n- Project deliverables are too academic for this class & the people who are taking it. Literature review? Testbed? Poster presentation? Class would be better served by having a project that more directly focuses on ML and visualization than hitting academic check-boxes.  \n- Covers too many technologies. Homework 3 covers PySpark, Scala Spark, Databricks, AWS, and GCP. While all are interesting, this leaves students ill-equipped to speak with confidence about any of them. In my CIOS response, I made a lengthy case that students would be better served from getting deeper knowledge in one technology and one platform (e.g. PySpark on AWS is probably best).\n- Be prepared to do the entire group project with 3 members rather than 6. RE-READ THIS PLEASE. I naively tried to get uncooperative group members to contribute to our project, and it made the whole experience way worse. There will probably be people in your group who give 0 shirts about contributing, and want to ride off the others. It's just a fact of the OMSCS/OMSA group project dynamic; be prepared to deal with it.\n- Lectures are so superficial as to not be useful",

Even within one homework, as soon as I finished one question, it's totally forgotten, too much info to digest and remember. Difficulty is low, it is just the amount of work, and its spread, that kills you. It is like running a long never ending boring marathon. If you truly do this course right, it will take more than 30 hours per week. I see some putting 15-20 hours, but I having 20 years coding experience in all languages, I keep SMH.  I had to drop a course, I couldn't keep up with both of the barely made it within ~30 hours per week. So I keep SMH when I see 15 hours per week.  ( I had no problem at all finishing CSE 6040 & ISYE 6501 both at once)\n\nD3.js is covered nicely. I enjoyed D3.js as well implementing Random Forest, Microsoft ML and trying out some other vendors. However, implementing Random Forest, or trying all large database implementations, I think it was off topic. Mixing so much and many things in such little time doesn't help, it becomes counterproductive. I already forgot most of them. If this class it is meant \"make it or break it\", yes, than it achieved the goal.\n\nAfter 2 weeks, all I remember is ~ 30% of it:\n1. Principles of Data Visualizations (Tufte)\n2. D3.js, \n3. Microsoft ML tools.    \n4. The long and constantly demanding course project.\n\nProf. Polo is very friendly, supportive and active.

I will caveat that my day job is a FE engineer, and I was already interested in Data Viz, which is why I signed up in the first place.\n\nThe assignments were a bit contrived. There are 4, and each one comes with a 10+ page instructions doc that goes step by step through everything you need to do. Sometimes on the order of \"click this button, type in this thing, click that button\". It was very prescriptive. But I had no trouble completing the assignments. There were I think 2 actual assignment corrections that people got mad about, but given there were hundreds of instructions/things being graded, that seemed acceptable to me.\n\nEach homework question has a Piazza megathread, so you can ctrl+f your way to the relevant post. For this reason, I recommend waiting a few days after the homework opens to get started - at that point many of the confusing bits will be clarified and other students will have worked out the kinks for you.  \n\nYes one homework is all about D3. That can be super daunting for people with limited web dev experience. I have plenty of experience and I still didn't like D3; it doesn't follow any of the best practices I've come to love. But! I super appreciate the flexibility D3 offers and I'm thankful I know a bit about how to use it. That will definitely be useful later in my career (even if just to veto the use of D3!). \n\nThe group project is what you make it. Have fun with it! Find a group with a good mix of abilities and set your expectations with everyone early on. I had a great group and we executed quite well. \n\nIt was annoying how the last few homeworks overlapped with the group project. I'd rather have spent more time on the group project. \n\nAnother complaint I read about is how you survey a bunch of technologies but don't go deep on any of them. Take it in stride! You're gonna learn a bunch of new tech and what it's good for, quickly! I'm not sure why people think that's a bad thing. You can always go back and learn more about it later. I'm happy I got the chance to learn how to use AWS, GCP, Azure, etc etc. If I ever need to do it again, I won't be a total n00b.\n\nThe lectures were enjoyable to me, but they don't actually count (outside of some bonus points). If you want want to watch them, then just don't.\n\nJust my two cents. I really liked this class, but I took it knowing it was something I was already interested in and pretty good at. I did pair this class with ML4T and still felt the workload was manageable. \n\nFWIW, I'm OMSCS and this was my 4th/5th class. I don't recommend this as a first class. ",

                        "body": "This was my first course in OMSCS program. Not sure about others but I genuinely liked this course because I learnt a lot of new things. Here are my evaluating metrics \n\n1) **Lectures (3/5)**\n\nPros:\nLectures were very informative and gave good intro about the week's content. Other than D3 and Pyspark syntax part, I need not do any additional study to do any of the assignments\n\nCons:\nThey lack the depth required in the assignments ( specially D3) and also need a revamp as the version used in the lectures are very old.\n\n2) **Homeworks (5/5)**\n\nThey were challenging and interesting and I could feel the hard work done by instructors to create them.\n\n**HW1** : Involved 5 parts. Graded on Gradescope.\nI started early and took me 20-25 hours to finish it given 2 weeks of time.\n\ni) creation of graphs, some graph related methods and display the nodes and edges and visualize it on a given tool.\n\nii) Write complex SQL queries for SQLite\n\niii) D3 warmup\n\niv) Open Refine\n\nv) Python Flask\n\n**HW2** : Involved 5 parts. Manually graded by TAs. \nI started early and took me a week's time to finish it given 2 weeks of time.  It was the most difficult assignment for most of the class but I found it most interesting. \n\ni) some barcharts on Tableau\n\nii) Forced Directed Graph Layout on D3\n\niii) Line charts on D3\n\niv) Line charts with interactive visualization on D3\n\nv) Choropleth Map in D3\n\n\n**HW3** : Involved 5 parts. Manually graded by TAs. \nI started early and took me a 4 days to finish it given 2 weeks of time.  Mostly time was spent in setup of all environments.\n\ni) Complete methods and Run Pyspark notebook on Docker container\n\nii) Complete methods and Run Pyspark notebook in Scala on Databricks\n\niii) Complete methods and Run Pyspark notebook in Python on AWS\n\niv) Complete methods and Run Pyspark notebook in Python on GCP\n\nv) Some easy experiments with Azure ML studio\n\n\n**HW4** : Involved 3 parts.  Graded on Gradescope.\nI started early and took me a week's time to finish it given 2 weeks of time. It was most difficult for me as I was new with ML models, decision tree and Page Rank.\n\ni) Implement Page Rank and Personalized Page Rank Algorithms\n\nii) Implement Random Forest Classifier\n\niii) Create and train various ML models using Scikit-Learn\n\n\n3) **Group Project (3/5)**\n\nIt had 50% weightage on course grades (don't know why instructors decided so). Although there was learning during group project and our outcome was nice but my experience was very dreadful. \n**NOTE FOR INSTRUCTORS** \nIn case you are reading this,  \nThis time I worked really hard and my teammates got free marks for that. Please make it an individual project so that others can benefit from it.\n\nPros: \ni) Learnt a lot of new algorithms while reading lot of research papers\n\nii) Learnt more about Data collection and Cleaning\n\nii) Learnt more about ML models and D3\n\niv) Latex\n\nCons:\ni)  Despite carefully choosing a team based on skills, got a bad team\n\nii) Had to do 90% of the work alone as other team members were only active two days before submission deadlines\n\niii) You can't make your team members deliver the things they committed to do. \n\n4) **TAs/Instructors (5/5)**\n\nThey (35+)  were helpful atleast I found them useful. They replied on everyone's piazza post within 8 hours and often used to review our codes in office hours. \nOnce I was wrongly graded in quiz and HW , I reported it and it was quickly resolved on submission of regrade requests.\n\n5) **Bonus Quizzes/Questions** (5/5)\n\nThey were entirely based on lectures and someone who has watched all lecture videos carefully and can easily score 100%.\n\nOn a final note, it was an easy course for me ( maybe because I am a software engineer) and I was idle half the time and wondered why didn't I took one extra course with this. My advice would be start early on every assignment and project deliverable so that you don't have to rush towards the end. If you study regularly for 1-2 hour daily, you can get an easy A, I believe.\n\n",

                        "body": "As someone who has experience in basic programming concepts (not a software engineer), this class was not as difficult as I thought. Yes the D3 was difficult, but it still applies the same basic debugging practices, and programming concepts I've encountered in previous courses. I also do recommend getting familiar with Javascript before the course starts and I agree, there's no way someone could learn Javascript and complete the D3 assignment in the allotted time frame.\n\nHowever, this is hands down the worst class I have ever taken (including my undergraduate experience). Besides learning about D3, no other content was related to \"Data and Visual Analytics\". It was basically more python practice with using a basic API and how to call methods in scikitlearn, applying SQL statements, and SQL like methods in technologies such as Spark and using the same concept in some cloud computing platforms. Then out of nowhere, creating a decision tree from scratch. I'm sorry to say, but the lectures are also awful. It feels like a salesperson talking about a product instead of actually learning any actual concepts and how to apply them to any situation. Other people saying \"the lectures are only worth 3 bonus points\" doesn't mean anything regarding the learning experience. I don't watch lectures for a letter grade, but to actually learn and the lectures are a waste of time. I could go on, but I haven't even discussed the worst part of class: The group project.\n\nThis mandatory group project is an absolute nightmare. You are forced into this matchmaking arena before the course even starts to showcase your background like a dating profile, and hope you match up with compatible people. As a disclaimer, I actually had no problem with my team at all, found my group mates really quick and enjoyed working with every single one of them. Once your legion is formed, you have to come up with a project topic that can literally be about anything regarding big data. However, you are forced to create the most ridiculous project deliverables I have ever encountered. Your initial project proposal document requires a document that cites 18 different scholarly level literature references. All within 2 letter size pages. Not to mention, you also have to answer 9 different questions within the same document. Another example is creating a proposal video, that talks about all your literature references, the 9 questions, and did I mention you only get a 2 min limit? The worse part is when you get feedback and points taken off saying \"You didn't go into enough detail about your xyz algorithm and how it works.\" Well yea, WE ONLY HAD 2 MINUTES. Other examples include strict limits on a progress report, poster presentation, poster presentation video, final report, all while working on the actual project itself. These restrictions also make no sense, especially if the requirements are just plain tedious. Our group spent most of our time making sure our documents had \"key\" words and fulfilled a checkbox of items, and not focusing on writing up project documentation to the best of our abilities. Lastly, all the project grades are based on filling out these unnecessary documents and not the actual project itself! We don't actually showcase the project, or get graded on any demo, but how we well we wrote about a project concept in some documents. You can include optional demo videos with again a strict time limit, but the rubric states it won't hurt or help you (which also makes no sense since this should be the most important part of the project). Never had I worked so hard for so little value. I don't mind group projects, but this project was meaningless. All of us actually used prior knowledge and outside experience and nothing from the class itself in putting together this project. From a tuition standpoint, I am glad my company sponsors this program, or else I would be furious for paying for a course that tells me to work on a meaningless group project."

                        "body": "I will start by saying that I didn't think this class was awful - for all of its problems, I actually did find much of the content fascinating and felt like I learned a fair amount. That said, the amount of time that needs to be invested to get a good grade in CSE 6242 versus the amount that you actually learn is way out-of-whack.\n\nMy Background\n-----------\nI&#39;m an OMSA student who was a business major undergrad and has worked in business analyst finance/consulting jobs since graduating. I&#39;m a professional-grade SQL scripter and was good enough at Python to ace CSE 6040, but I had limited or no experience with other programming languages, cloud computing platforms, or machine learning beyond a theoretical conception of it. I mention this because I think the people who disliked this class the most were software engineers who have familiarity with these technologies, whereas I actually appreciated the class&#39;s introduction to them.\n\nThe Pros\n-----------\n- **Good content for the unfamiliar** - like I said, I had almost no background with D3, cloud computing platforms, or machine learning, and I actually appreciated the introduction! Now, I know just a little bit more about web development, I&#39;m a little more familiar with systems that run on the cloud, and I feel like I can do some basic data science in Python. This is why I signed up for OMSA degree!\n- **Informative lectures** - the lectures were also quality content, if you actually watched them. More on that below.\n\nThe Cons\n-----------\n- **Overall tediousness of homework** - while I felt like I learned from the homework, it was WAY more tedious than it needed to be. So much time on the homework was spent figuring out why one little thing isn&#39;t quite working right or scouring Piazza (a platform badly in need of upgrading) for the bit of information you need. I would have much preferred if the homeworks were more bite-sized like in CSE 6040 - it&#39;d be much easier to feel like progress was being made and would have made the class less stressful.\n- **Throwing you in the deep end with D3** - Homework 2 deserves its own call-out. The [Suggested Background Knowledge](https://omscs.gatech.edu/cse-6242-data-visual-analytics) of the class says you should be, &quot;proficient in at least one high-level programming language (e.g., Python, C++, Java) and are efficient with debugging principles and practices; if you are not, you should instead first take CSE 6040 (for OMS Analytics students) and if needed, CS 1301 and CS 1371.&quot; This is untrue. It is _impossible_ to succeed on Homework 2 without at least having introductory-level knowledge to JavaScript, it is _not_ good enough just to have CSE 6040-level knowledge of Python. I recommend anyone taking this course take the Introduction to JavaScript on CodeAcademy before. All that said, I actually enjoyed learning about D3 and felt like I could make some really cool things with it! But the path to get there required the use of wayyy more outside resources than a class like this should.\n- **No grading incentive to watch the (informative) lectures** - the lectures aren&#39;t really linked to the Homework, they are only linked to quizzes that are worth a total of 3 bonus points that can be earned on your final grade. I think this is a shame - I would actually have preferred this class to have tests based on the lectures instead of the group project, because there would have been a much stronger link between learning the actual material and one&#39;s final grade in the course. Which leads me to my final con...\n- **The Group Project. All of it.** - just do away with the whole thing, and I say this as someone who was part of a great group that has done well on all components of the project. The idea that we need to be scheduling to meet with others to work on the project just fundamentally runs against one of the major draws of an online program (that you can do it on your own time), and I feel like I didn&#39;t learn anything from the project either. It started out with academic research (why??) and then we had to develop our own visualization/model - my group did this off a combination of things they learned from other classes and regurgitating homework things. Because I was the only person on my project who was both a native speaker of English and not a professional software engineer, I got stuck doing research/report-writing. This allocation of roles optimized our group for success grade-wise, but I didn&#39;t learn anything new about analytics as a result. Polo points to &quot;learning how to work with a group&quot; as one of the big reasons why the project should be part of the course, but that&#39;s not what I signed up for OMSA for! If the degree was undergraduate or on-campus, I think Polo&#39;s point would be stronger, but I experience group dynamics every day during my day job and don&#39;t benefit from more of them after-hours.\n\nAll in all, I think the best way to fix this class would be maybe split it into two classes and go deeper into the content. Have one class that covers Visualization Theory and Practice very thoroughly (and properly introduces students to JavaScript), and have another class for Cloud Computing and Applications that dives deeper into these technologies and shows how they can be used to manage data processing and machine learning models. And axe the group project completely.",

You are taught NOTHING. I took a class on and read a textbook about D3 in advance of this class and still felt very unprepared for some of the assignments. The lectures are basically useless. If we're required to use a language in our homework, why aren't we taught the language?\n\nThe entire class is 4 homework assignments and a group project. The homework assignments are 14+ pages long. They are often confusing and have errors. \n\nThe one positive thing I can say is that the grading is quite fair, though you can lose points for a number of very small errors, like an extra space in your filename (this is not hyperbole). That said, the grading on the homework is OVERALL fairly generous. On most questions, you can get partial credit. The final homework,  however, had a question worth 35% of the grade (3.5 points of your overall score) that was pass/fail. Get it all right, with the minimum accuracy, or you get a 0. There were also bonus quizzes offered (though only for a maximum of 3 points).\n\nReally, the worst class I have ever taken.",

The lectures are dry and lack depth. The homework is extremely repetitive and surface level.

A poster???\n\nMy past self believed that having things like \"Databricks\", \"Hadoop\", and all the other softwares touted on the syllabus would look great on my resume. My current self thinks it would be disingenuous to put those on my resume because of how little we actually did with those tools. It would be like if I wrote a \"hello world\" program in C++ and then had the audacity to put \"Expert in C++\" on my resume.\n\nTo my past self, and all others thinking of taking the class for similar reasons: please don't.

                        "body": "After this semester, I am halfway done with OMSA degree. Combining with all the classes I took in my undergrad at a different institution, this class was the worst academic experience I've ever encountered. Mind you, it isn't that difficult to get an A here. I will be getting an A unless I get 55 or below in this project, which is quite unlikely to happen. However, the experience is so bad that for the first time in my life, I am motivated to write a review of a course. The reason why this course is terrible is because of the following things: \n\n1. This course covers too many unrelated topics at a shallow level. The course title is data and visual analytics, but in reality, only 1 of the 4 homeworks is on visualization (HW2 the infamous D3 homework). I don't mind the long instructions on each homework, but those long instructions still do not adequately explain what we need to do at times. One of the questions in the first HW requires us to use a software that the professor made, which will not likely be used in the industry. The third HW is basically do the same things in each question except on different platforms (AWS, Google Cloud, Databricks), and the fourth HW suddenly asks you to build a random forest from scratch. They are definitely not related to visualization, and the topics don't connect. I've been exposed to tons of software, but only at a hello world level. Frankly, I was surprised that they don't teach things like Python's seaborn and bokeh, when they are some of the major ways we do visualizations now. \n\n2. I am sure the TAs were instructed to be this way to not spoon feed us, but lots of TAs can be unhelpful. Whenever I asked a question, they just said look here in the instructions, when I asked that question because I wanted to clarify what the instructions said. Some TAs were helpful, but I would say majority were not. The professor is also pretty much absent in the class. \n\n3. Half of your grade is on a really vague project. First of all, you must be in a group project so your grade could be determined by who you will be with, which is a challenge since a majority of us do not know each other in the class. Second of all, the project instructions are super long, but they somehow still miss requirements in that instructions and have to post additional ones in Piazza, which you will likely miss if you don't pay  attention. Thirdly, this project is structured way too academically. Majority of us will not go on to the academic field, but from the very beginning, they require us to read and write literature survey on somewhere between 12-18 papers per group. They require you to make video presentations of your project, which I frankly find meaningless. I get why they require you to make individual presentations of the final project, but I really don't get the point of making presentations about the proposal in the beginning of the project. It is almost impossible to fail this project, but they are very picky about what they want. They also gave us feedback on the progress report one week before the final project was due, and I've seen some groups that were unable to accommodate those feedbacks because there were not enough time. \n\n4. The lectures are absolutely meaningless. HWs and projects almost have nothing to do with the lectures or are doable without lectures. You need them for max 3% bonus points from quizzes, but they post the transcript and you can just search up questions. There are also quite a few moments where he says things like \"I mentored this kid for PhD\" or \"we made this in our lab\" and even things like \"this lecture was largely based off of this lecture from ___ university by professor ___\" which I find it very discouraging. \n\nI also asked my project teammates just to see if I was the only one feeling this way, and all 3 of them felt the same as I did, and I know at least 2 of them are doing fine in terms of grades. \n\nSo in a few points: \n* not a difficult course to get an A, but very very time consuming and tedious\n\n*they throw lots and lots and lots of topics (which I appreciate since most of them are applicable in industry), but they are unrelated and shallow in depth\n\n*lectures don't help. Don't waste time watching them. \n\n*Start HW early, especially HW2. It might be good if you brush up on D3 basics in advance of this course. \n\n*Choose project teams and topics wisely and early. ",

So, I can gripe about the fact that the course is scattered across a ton of disjoint topics, or the fact that it relies on poorly implemented autograders, or that 50% of the course is based on a project where you can \u201cdo anything you want\u201d, except when you can\u2019t.  I could complain about how, in one assignment, you need to write code in a jupyter notebook that outputs a .py file that you have to upload to an autograder that provides almost no debugging info, or how you need to be able to implement, for decision trees, python code that leverages recursion, which is never even mentioned.  I could complain about how the syllabus is a web page that is about 10 pages long, and references another web page for the project that is about 10 pages long\u2026 and yet, somehow, manages to tell you next to nothing.  I could gripe about how it seems that half the TAs are arrogant CS students that are out to prove how smart they are.  Lastly, I could gripe about the fact that they literally rolled their own docker container for spark... and it just plain didn\u2019t work.  You don\u2019t need to do that, folks.  There are docker containers that are already pre-made that were created by the Apache spark project... and they actually friggin\u2019 WORK!\n\nBut, rather than just go on and on about how awful this course is, here are some tips for, if not success, then survival.  1.  Get on good project team and get it early.  2.  The project is graded by \u201cbox checkers\u201d.  Make DAMN sure you understand exactly what is required for each part of the project by understanding the rubric.  And, yes, they really want you to sum up the entire project in the proposal video in 2 minutes.  3.  Read up on D3 and search the web on how to implement decision trees (you\u2019ll need to understand recursion) and random forests from scratch.  (I did both of these, and they made homeworks 1 and 4 go much more smoothly.)  4.  The bonus point quizzes can help.  Make sure you watch the videos first and get a copy of the transcript of the lectures.  The quizzes go very quickly (10 minutes for 11 questions, and no going back to a previous question.) 4.  Eventually, this class comes to an end.  So, make it through, take a shower, and then move on.  \n\nBottom line.  This class sucks.  It really sucks.  You have to take it\u2026 and that makes it suck all that much more. ",

Having a strong group for the project makes all the difference. Homeworks 3 and 4 can be completed in three days if you have a strong background. Homework one took about a week, and homework 2 took the longest because of D3. But that homework has a lot of online resource support. Lectures only serve a surface level survey of a topic; they are meant for bonus points. The course also ends early in the term with no exams, which is a plus. I think this course is a great first or second course to pick up in the program, however know that the course is geared largely to experiential learning and surveying some of the most popular analytics technology in the field. You'll find yourself on several stack overflow posts and online tutorials to complete the work. The work itself is not terribly difficult if you have a Python/JS background. My largest complaint is the homeworks were very wordy and contained some errors that needed to be updated in subsequent versions, which hindered progress.",

To be warned, you'll have to juggle VERY difficult assignments and do the project, which is a time suck on its own.  The lectures in this class are pretty useless (you can pretty much get through the class without even needing to watch a lecture (also you can just use the find function in the transcripts to do the bonus quizzes).\n\nIn addition, it felt like the most USEFUL stuff was barely touched (like AWS and other computing stuff, d3, etc).  There was no emphasis put on any of the python data viz packages (?????) like seaborn and what not.  I understand how data manipulation is important, why not fill in the class with more useful things than have us do a class project where people have to literally scrounge up something and hope something sticks on the wall with a makeshift team.\n\nAlso the grading criteria for the projects seems all over the place, getting docked for points on things that weren't even mentioned they were going to be graded on.\n\nThe one positive thing so far is that the homeworks and what not are very useful and interesting.  It's just the dumpster fire in everything else (the class project, the way the lectures are structured) that makes it probably one of the worst classes I have ever taken.",

If possible, take a course on D3 or watch the 12-hour \"complete tutorial\" on YouTube and complete it. Do all of that before you start this class. Just build it into your previous semester.\n\nMy second advice is personal. I have struggled with mental health issues of anxiety and depression for about 12 years now. I was on an improvement track with these issues. Combining this class with the Covid-19 pandemic and a few other family issues has derailed my progress. No joke to say that I'm only 6 weeks into DVA and have met twice already with my psychiatrist and have had numerous discussions with my partner so as to minimize filling my head with self-demeaning talk and negative thoughts. Point being, if you have mental health issues you deal with already, put all of your support systems in place for this class. I literally had to talk myself out of dropping out of GT altogether -- and I'm one semester away from graduating.\n\nI'm going to get a B or C in this class. It is ok. Because making an A would probably kill me.  So just take it in stride and learn what you can and move on. You are a beautiful, wonderful, smart, and worthwhile human being even if this class might try to make you think otherwise about yourself.  Peace to you all.",

Even though I got high marks, it was the single worst experience I ever had as a student. 50% of the grade is based on 4 HW assignments, and the other 50% is based on a semester-long group project. The amount of work is definitely taxing, especially in the final 6 weeks, but the course is made worse by how poorly the instructors (i.e., professor and TAs) run it.\n\nThe homework assignments were challenging because students are essentially learning new software or languages that they may have never utilized (e.g., D3). However, this aspect isn't the terrible portion. The truly dreadful aspect is the fact that the homework instructions were literally 10+ pages long, and they were riddled with mistakes and errors. Students had to satisfy every single requirement, or the TAs would deduct points with limited reasoning. If the instructions changed, or if an error was corrected, or if something unclear was clarified (which all happened far too often), then the TAs usually provided the necessary details in a Piazza post, buried under other posts from students, instead of providing a revised set of instructions for the entire class to see, like the syllabus says they would.\n\nThe project is another mess entirely. It is structured like an academic research project. The main focus is to take a \"big\" data set, perform non-trivial analysis on it (e.g., clustering, classification, etc.), and then present the results in an interactive visualization. In addition, students needed to write a large research paper, similar to ones published in academic journals, and in the paper, we had to write an extensive literature review on 12-18 sources, depending on the size of our group. I understand the importance of explaining processes and results, but too much emphasis was placed on the research paper. The OMSA program is designed for people who intend to work in the private sector, not for those pursuing a career in academia. The time spent writing the paper could have been better served learning more about the tools covered in the HW assignments.\n\nContinuing on, the group project required the submission of a project proposal and presentation, as well as a progress report about three weeks before the project was due. The final project submission occurred a couple of weeks before the official end of the semester. The final submission needed to include: the final paper; all of the code that was written (with comments and explanations); all of the other supporting files (e.g., diagrams, data files, etc.); a presentation poster that explained the completed project; and a README file that outlined everything in the final submission. And just like the homework, the TAs combed through every little detail for all of the deliverables. If something didn't meet their subjective standards, then they deducted points, and the reasoning they provided was often limited.\n\nThe most frustrating aspect of the class was that the TAs and professor are simply not helpful, whatsoever. In fact, some of the TAs were incredibly condescending towards the students. The TAs were the ones who put together the homework instructions for each assignment and every single one was riddled with errors and contradictions. The same problem also persisted with their Piazza posts. For example, there were several occasions in which the TAs gave demonstrably false information, and then the professor had to make a post just to correct them. I was definitely challenged in this course, and I learned quite a bit. However, the class is so poorly managed and executed that it was an absolute nightmare to endure.",

                        "body": "We were warned about the amount of effort in the syllabus, so I can't say it came as a surprise. The TAs and the professor were always available to answer questions fast and well.\n\nHowever, I'm not leaving this class with a fulfilling feeling of accomplishment. I didn't do too bad in the end (probably around 89.6%), but I'm still leaving extremely frustrated.\n\nFirst, because this course is a core requirement, and it should not be. It's halfway between the Analytics and Computer Science MSc, meaning it's optimized for neither, and therefore should not be core.\n\nIt also should not be core because too much of what it teaches is not core to analytics. Having half the homeworks covering Javascript and D3 is ludicrous for analysts. Javascript is a fantastic language but not a requirement for most analytics positions. Many other technologies and libraries such as R and Python, ggplot, matplotlib, bokeh, seaborn and much more widely used and completely absent of this Visual Analytics course. So in a core requirement course, we have to pick up a tech that we're unlikely to use, and get zero exposure or deepening on techs we are sure we have to master.\n\nYes, new positions will come with a requirement to learn new skills and technologies in a limited amount of time. But nobody will ever ask an analyst without JS experience to output 8 different interactive visualizations in 30 days - at least not without a personal trainer.\n\nAlthough I'm admirative of the work produced by previous students, I don't see the point in making us use their tools, like the network graph representation one. We're being graded on a tool that we never used and that is far from being an industry standard. There is no point in asking us to use such a tool, except for boosting usage of the tool, which might be nice for the developers but is irrelevant for the students. That's not what we paid for nor expect from this course.\n\nI also understand the strictness and rigidness of requirements and the absence of appeal post due-date, but I found myself stressing a lot more about meeting these structural/administrative requirements than about my results. I paid close attention in duplicating the downloaded directories and submitting exactly what was asked, and still managed to submit the wrong notebook for the main PySpark question which cost me 35 points on the homework. It's a tech I already know, I would have gotten most of the points and caught up on my D3 disaster, and my final grade is impacted because after hours in front of the screen I messed up the upload without a way to correct it later. Granted, it's on me, but in the end my grade reflects more my ability to follow cumbersome guidelines than to master skills necessary to analysts.\n\nThis course tries to do too much. Visualization, big data, three different cloud platforms... I'd prefer this course focus on visualization only. There, we would have three months to learn about D3, which is a much more decent timeline. We could also work with the R and Python visualization libraries, as well as get a certification level with Tableau. Doing analysis on the cloud should be its own course, and big data analytics as well - and it is, so these parts basically just come as an ersatz of other Analytics courses, and are therefore useless in the grand scheme of things as far as the Master of Analytics is concerned.\n\nThe lectures are not helpful at all. They just give a contextual understanding but don't get you any closer to completing the homeworks. It really feels like a \"struggle and do it\" experience, which is absolutely necessary for mastery, but considering the price paid for the classes I expect more guidance and support than being given projects, being told they are hard, and being asked to figure it out on my own. I see no difference with me doing that with free resources and projects I can come up with myself.\n\nIn a nutshell, it's a core requirement, you have to take it, but it's a grind. Start the homeworks as soon as they are released and you'll be OK.",

                        "body": "This was my first course in OMSCS, and I was really glad that I took this as my first course. Obviously, that conclusion is based on my personal preferences. Writing/reading, and doing exams has never really been my strong suit. And given I have been out of the academic life for 15+ years, I really wanted a hands-on class that relied more on my programming skills rather than theory. I wasn't disappointed in that. \n\nAlso it helped that I have had a variety of experiences with different programming languages, so that helped adapting to everything that they throw at you in this class. And so I understand some of the negative reviews here, because if you are not relatively well versed with JavaScript, Python, SQL etc. you will need to put in extra effort to very quickly learn to work in these languages. I had never worked in Python but luckily had experience in Ruby that helped me learn Python in time. Nevertheless I still had to put in a LOT of effort. \n\nNow for a more structured review:\n\n# Course content\n\n**Homeworks**\n1. The homework (4 of them) take a lot of effort and are 50% of grade\n1. Each homework is like 15 pages long, and has up to 5 questions\n1. Each question is often a different programming language, technology, tool, or field of area in DVA world.\n1. You have to really work for each single point (100pts per homework) because there are just so many items to do in each question, and most tasks are granular.\n\n**Project**\n\n1. Group project, with 50% of grade. Form a group ASAP and start brainstorming because homeworks will not give you much time\n1. A lot of freedom on what you can do and what you choose to utilize\n1. More emphasis (and grade yield) is from the the proposals and reports, and final poster+presentation, rather than the actual software\n1. It has to be an interactive application, having \"non-trivial\" analysis and visualizations.\n\n# The good/the bad\n\n*Pros*\n\n - You get to learn a lot of different technologies in this course\n - Because of the breadth of problems and tools thrown at you, you really get over the fear of doing something completely different and new just because you never felt that you were suited for that kind of thing. Like allocating several distributed computing resources on cloud services so that you can run your algo that sifts through large datasets. \n - No exams\n - Lenient grading, on the project\n - Practical and hands on homeworks, that walk you through so many new things, that it will feel very rewarding to complete them\n - Given the granularity of grading so well defined, at project and homework level, you can very easily choose to put in as much effort as your intended grade. \n - Responsive TAs, and professor often interacts with students on Piazza\n - Very interesting subject, has a little bit for every kind of person\n - Lectures are well made\n - Get several chances for bonus points, you can score ~105% in total\n\n*Cons*\n\n - Due to the amount of things to be done in the homework, the descriptions are often plagued with minor typos/errors, and ambiguities. This is a damned if you do and damned if you don't kind of a situation. Too many things to do (and to accurately describe what to do) means too much text necessary to completely cover everything. But time and practical constraints would force you to limit those to 15 page/homework, and thus will have tasks that are often vague, and some that are too detailed. \n - The above leads to too much (way too much) effort to fully flush out what you exactly need to do (autograding or unit test like tools are not available)\n - The reason for the too much effort in previous point is the amount of students (~1000) in a single Piazza section. There is just too much noise. Before even you have started your homework (thinking I am gonna be up and early on this) there are already 100+ posts on each sub-section of each question on piazza.\n - And if you don't actually take the effort to go through hundreds of repetitive posts on all questions you will MOST DEFINITELY miss important points to cover to actually get the grade for the question. Unsurprisingly things are tricky at this level of education. (of course for those that would like to achieve 100%).\n - Project \"Grouping\"... somewhat.\n - Lectures were underwhelming, not in quality, but in quantity. They were few, and did not cover as much of the \"analytics\" and \"visualizations\" as I had hoped. ",

                        "body": "Well, where to begin? And how to add anything to the other zillion reviews here that have all mostly said the same things?\n\nI should start by saying that I took this as my last class. This was very much intentional as I know that I am sub-par at coding and that this class would be a real grind. My thinking was that by taking it last, I'd have strong motivation to persevere when the going got tough. \n\nOk, so you all know by now that the class consists of four homework assignments that will take a significant amount of time and that there's a group project that will also take a big chunk of time and involve all the usual things that group projects involve. Assignments will consist of a potpourri of languages and tools (sql, python, d3, spark/scala, tableau, azure ML, etc.). Everyone knows this and it's included in literally every review. So I'll try to add something unique, I hope. \n\nI will address those who are intimidated, like me, in taking this class for fear that they don't have the coding ability necessary to really succeed. This was me. I got a C in 6040. After that class, I feared I wasn't going to make it through the program. But hey, I'm graduating in May...\n\nComing into DVA, I felt I'd probably be in big trouble. Reading some prior reviews where those with significant development experience refer to the class as \"a lot of work\" meant that, for someone like me, it would be a WHOLE lot of work. I mentally allocated 4 hours a day, 7 days a week. This turned out to be little more than a fantasy as work and home life quickly began to eat away at my school time and I began to fall behind.\n\nHomework 1 contained one problem that was 40% of the grade, then, like 4 or 5 other little problems. I could not for the life of me get that first problem to work, and just punted on it. Somehow, was able to get the rest done reasonably, but still only got a score in the 50's due to missing that first problem. \n\nHomework 2 was the famous D3 homework, where, again, I shipped a nice 50ish on it. It was here, gentle reader, that I realized three fundamental truths at the exact same time (no, I'm not a girl in a world in which my only job is to marry rich)...sorry, been listening to Hamilton soundtrack...I digress...where was I? Oh...,right!\n\nCue Morpheus voice/meme: \"What if I told you that you don't need an 'A' in this class?\"\n\nThat's right. You don't even need a 'B' in this class. Heck, you don't even need a 'C' in this class. People have graduated the program with D's on their transcript.\n\nSecond, the project is graded leniently. If your team checks off all the boxes, you will likely get an A on your project. And since that's 50% of the course grade...\n\nThis means you can take a deep breath. Do your best on the homework,  learn as much as you can, and even if you don't do great and turn in some 50's, you'll be fine. \n\nAbout that project. \n\nAgain, this advice, and indeed this whole review, is for those who are not so savvy with coding. \n\nKnowing that I wasn't doing so hot on the homework, I really focused on taking care of my project team and my responsibilities. Even to the point of prioritizing it over homework. \n\nIn joining a project team, be up front and honest about your abilities (or lack thereof) and that you will be more than happy to handle any and all reporting. It turns out that the report writing/research and so on are at least as significant an amount of work as the coding. Believe me. \n\nParticularly if the coding is shared by two (front end/back end) someone will have to do the proposal, which may involve hours of finding and reading through 15 to 20 research papers, then synthesizing into something approaching a paper of your own. Finding that first 5 research papers is easy (remember, they have to be a certain length, and peer reviewed, etc.). The next handful things start to get rough. By the time you've sourced 20 of them, you realize that you've by no means gotten the \"easy job\" and that this is a lot of work. \n\nThere will then be a proposal video presentation, a progress and final reports. Finally, a project poster. Again, this all will take at least as much time as any technical work. Volunteer for this duty if you are uncomfortable with the coding side. \n\nOther project advice: designate someone as a PM from the beginning. I don't have to tell you that a good PM has to be the right personality, but having someone make sure the trains run on time will be important. I had a pretty good team (thankfully, we had an OMSCS guy on it). But, at times, I felt that meetings lacked a little focus and communications could have been a little better. A good PM would have been useful. \n\nAnywho, I had a final score in the high 70's and ended up with a 'B', which I was more than happy with. I enjoyed challenging myself with the homework, and didn't get too stressed out on those sections that were a bit too time consuming for me. I enjoyed HW3 the most, and thus completed more of it that the others. But, with a job in the health insurance industry, work got a bit too crazy, so I had to make some 'life optimization' decisions and just do my best. \n\nBottom line, if you are that biz track student who struggled mightily with 6040 and fear that this class will do you in, you can make it, but you might not get that shiny new 'A' and have to settle for less. Just look at the class as a way to challenge yourself as much as you can to YOUR ability, be a good teammate on your project, and you'll get through it. \n\n\n\n",

I can agree with some of the negative comments about the detailed homework assignments and how there were errors that were only corrected in Piazza posts that could easily be missed, and it was difficult to get real help from the TAs - partly because the assignments were so involved. I made it a habit to CTRL-F through the Piazza posts, and I definitely found useful nuggets that helped get me through. Piazza in general is not my favorite, but I've learned how to get what I need out of it.\n\nThat being said, I do feel like I learned a lot in the course out of necessity. I felt satisfied completing the homework assignments because they were hard and pushed me to learn the programming concepts and syntax. I watched a lot of YouTube/Linked In Learning videos on D3 and Javascript in particular, because they were totally new to me. Also PySpark and recursive queries for decision trees. \n\nI would have preferred an additional homework assignment and no group project. With group projects, you really are learning more about group dynamics and how to deal with everyone being last minute than you are learning more about the concepts. Plus, it can be a pooling of ignorance at times because you're all in the same boat. I just don't think group projects are pedagogically useful, in general, in terms of the material. They're good \"life experience,\" I guess. I have no complaints about my group, but we were too ambitious to begin with and then we got stuck later. However, the grading was generous so it all turned out fine.\n\nThere are no exams in this class, which was nice. It was very hands-on, which is I why I feel like I learned a lot.",

                        "body": "I agree with a lot of the negative points from other reviews here \u2013 jumps around too much from topic to topic, doesn\u2019t focus as much on visualization as one would assume given the name of the course, somewhat disorganized, homework questions are often phrased vaguely and confusingly, the lectures and resources they provide aren\u2019t too useful and you'll do most of your learning from Stack Overflow and finding similar examples. Still, I generally enjoyed the course, felt that I learned a lot, good practice in learning new software and language on the fly. And, I appreciate that it\u2019s required in the OMSA curriculum in that even if people take the easiest electives possible \u2013 which still isn\u2019t a cakewalk \u2013 they\u2019re forced to take this as well, which IMO makes the degree more valuable since you know anyone who graduated passed this and is competent regardless of their other course choices. \n\nIt\u2019s not easy \u2013 for me personally I\u2019d say the second hardest course I\u2019ve taken, after only HDDA (which is an elective and easily avoidable if so inclined). And the grading is somewhat lenient especially with bonus points, it seems most of the class gets an A\u2026or withdraws/fails for not turning in assignments or cheating. So maybe \u201chard\u201d isn\u2019t the right word so much as time-consuming since you\u2019ll probably get an A, which you can\u2019t always say about many less-involved courses.\n\nA few random pieces of advice:\n* Pay very close attention to everything on the homework document, and don\u2019t make assumptions. For instance, they gave us some learning tools for version 4 of D3.js, but we had to use v5\u2026took me awhile to even realize this after several hours of beating my head against the wall, why is nothing working. Foolishly assuming a resource they gave us for a homework would work on said homework, silly me. \n* Don\u2019t go crazy trying to get the final few points on an assignment if you\u2019re really struggling and doing okay otherwise. Especially the further you get in the course and know you already have a decent grade\u2026for instance, I didn\u2019t even try the random forest from scratch, which was half of HW4. But I aced every other assignment and knew bonus points were coming \u2013 so even without that I still got an A. And frankly would\u2019ve been fine with a B\n* Going back to the above, don\u2019t expect your group project to reinvent the wheel. They want you to succeed here, don\u2019t give yourself an ulcer making something that revolutionizes the internet. If you can turn in something that adheres to the guidelines, you\u2019ll likely get a decent grade. The class average for every single deliverable for the project was over a 90%\n* Have the course notes open as you do the bonus quizzes. You can CTRL+F through most of the answers and those you can\u2019t, you can probably find on Google. ",

                        "body": "Goodness gracious did I hate this class. For SO many reasons. First off, I work as an analyst for a living. I've been using programming for statistics for about 7 years and grew up learning how to code basic things. My other education is economics and statistics so I have only had one or two true CS courses. \n\nThe good: \n- The content in the homeworks is actually relevant and fairly useful in the real world. \n\n- I did learn a ton (though keep reading, it wasn't because of the teaching staff)\n\n- The group project was okay. It was fun, loved my group, but hated the assignment description/rubrics/timing etc. More below.\n\nThe bad: \n- I hate to rag on other students but the TAs were CRAP. If you see the name Robert Donaldson, you're in for a horrible treat. He's a real jerk. They constantly contradict each other, their favorite response is to copy the part of the homework you're asking about and send it right back to you, and they often purposely avoid responding to \"help promote student interaction.\" BS if you ask me. \n\n- The timing of the group project with the homeworks is ROUGH. You will have long weeks, especially the last month or so of the active class time. \n\n\nThe ugly: \n- Polo Chau seems more interested in research than teaching (but who is surprised at something like that?) He is unengaged, commented maybe 10 times in the whole semester, and let his TAs run wild without guidance. His videos are useless and mostly just self promotion. I stopped watching after week 3 because they teach you nothing. \n\n- The homework and project assignments/instructions. They are the worst written and organized documents for academic use that I have ever seen. You have to re-read these 14 page documents to find TINY details like ascending vs descending order, whether your notepad file should be .txt or .csv even if it is comma separated, and other minute details. Miss one of them? You lose a minimum of 2% usually, if not the whole question depending on the error. They constantly re-release versions of the homework without warning so if you do any work in the first 5 days or so of the homework window you are probably going to have to redo it. The wording is often so unclear that you have to scroll through Piazza to find if/where someone posted about it and hope that a TA answered it. \n\n- Speaking of Piazza, whoever decided that making one piazza thread for 3-6 parts of a question was a good idea should be fired. Those threads get so long that if you click a hyperlink to a specific part of the thread, it can take MINUTES to load, if it loads at all. Additionally, they tend not to pin important posts so good luck if you see something important and forget to star it. \n\nI really hate that this class is required for OMSA. It only has about 25% to do with visualization so the title is misleading, it is not really taught for analytics student but CS students, and it is an obscene amount of work and money for little to no support. Still sort of in shock that GT would allow a course like this to stay in the program, particularly the OMSA curriculum. ",

Very early homework asked us to use a professor-created tool for visualizing graph, in which I will never expose it again. In fact, I am okay with that tool, but I think teaching us to use more generic libraries will be much more beneficial. \n\nClass project is heavily focused on how you comply to the grading criteria of the progress report, final report, and poster presentation. \n\nAfter all, it is a required course for me.

                        "body": "My Background: Non CS undergrad with 3 years of software engineering work experience. 1.5 years as a scala spark and 1.5 years of react & angular developing. This was my 3rd class in OMSCS program.\n\nThe assignments were generally easy for me with my spark and javascript background, but the assignments are tedious. I would usually finish each assignment within the first 2 weekends (~12hrs of work on each assignment), with HW2 (D3) > HW3 (spark) > HW4 (light ML topics) > HW1 (SQL) in terms of tedium. \n\nI think the most difficult thing in this class are working with the TA's and assignment requirements. A few times, homework requirements would change after they were released or TA's would clarify/redefine assignment criteria in piazza threads. So if you submit assignments early, but don't check Piazza everyday, you might end up missing that the TA's updated the starter code or requirements, and you might end up losing points. You can lose points on regrade requests, so you have to weigh if it's worth asking for the points back.\n\nThe team project requirements are also not as clear as they could be. For one example, my team lost points for not including literature review in our proposal slides as the rubric given did not say it was needed. Upon regrade request, the response from the TA was basically \"other teams included it, so you should've, too\", and we had a 5% deduction thereafter. \n\nOverall, using the different technologies and making D3 visualizations was somewhat interesting, but dealing with grading and TA's was frustrating. Overall, not a hard class if you have the background, but generally would not recommend unless you're just filling specialization requirements.",

When you're done with the class, there's no better feeling.\n\nCons: There's a lot, so stay with me here.  In no particular order:\n\n1.) The HW assignments were a mess.  You spend most of the time getting stuff set up, and there are always errors on the HW.  You have to constantly check Piazza even if you started working on assignments early, in case a requirement changed.  \n\n2.) The TAs.  Maybe I'm in the minority here, but in my opinion, the worst part of this class were the TAs.  I'm sure they were probably instructed by the professor to be super vague with their help on questions that were posted by students.  On the real, they provided absolutely NO VALUE to me.  Any time a question was answered, all they did was Google the general topic of the question being asked, and posted the first Stack Overflow article they found.  I don't mean to sound harsh, but the TAs serve absolutely no purpose in this class and were fundamentally useless.\n\n3.) The group project was a complete bleep show.  For starters, it's a complete free-for-all to find groups, so there's stress right off the bat, especially if you don't know anyone in the class (which is the case for a majority of the students).  The professor/TAs basically expected everyone to just post something about themselves and try to sell themselves on why they'd be a good teammate and what they'd bring to a team.  I thought this was a class and not LinkedIn?  Anyway, so after I lucked into finding a group, coordinating stuff with my group was a complete cluster.  I would say two of the five of us did most of the work, while the other three were pretty much useless.  I didn't care enough to call them out on their crap, because I just wanted to get through this class and get an A.  Maybe I handled that wrong, but the basic point I'm trying to make is that group projects are stupid and it is a complete roll of the dice on how it will turn out for you.  I'm sorry, but that's the truth.\n\nThe funny part about the TAs in this class being useless is that they were so nitpicky when it comes to grading different aspects of the project.  They definitely went through it with a fine-toothed comb, which is more than what I can say when it came to Piazza and helping students with the HWs.  It was almost comical some of the stuff we got docked on.\n\n4.) The lecture videos were useless.  For the bonus quizzes, just pull up the class transcript on one page and just do a Ctrl+F on each question.  You're welcome.\n\nGeneral comments:\nI thought the hardest HW assignment was the last one (#4), due to the random forest from scratch creation.  The d3 assignment (#2) was definitely tough, and I had no experience in Javascript before this class.  I managed to get 100% on this assignment and I turned it in a week early.  Just start the HWs early, and you won't have a problem.  Don't expect much help from the TAs (did I mention this already?).\n\nI am SO glad this class is over.",

I understand the feeling around that this course surveys too much contents and most contents stay at a very superficial level.\nBut what I think I get from this course is, it points me to the tools/techniques for practical problems I encountered in the past or may encounter in the future. Although, I don't think I learn much of tools/techinques from this course, I now know where to start looking if I want.\n\nNow is the details:\n4 Homework (Coding Assignment) + 1 Group Project (Coding + LOTS OF Reports + Presentation).\n\nEach homework is just a collection of small homeworks of related topics and bundled together.\n\n1) Different Usage of SQL\n2) Build Interative HTML page with Javascript + D3\n3) Different Kinds of Scalable Computing\n4) Implementation of some machine learning algorithms\n\nI have no prior experience with any of these knowledges except some basic understanding of SQL and machine learning algorithms I learnt from other courses in this OMSCS program. Each one just takes 10~20 hours to finish and for some homeworks we are spending most of the times setting up the environment.\n\nGroup project though takes a lot ot time to complete since there are a lot of reporting throughout the semester and the time is very limited. The pro is you are going work with a lot of amazing classmates (you probably will learn more from your classmates than from the course material). The con is I feel this kind of writes-up is very tedious and not very helpful.",

I can't believe rational people made a conscious decision that this class should be a mandatory experience for all of their students to share. I mean, leave aside the problems with the quality of the instruction I'm paying for for a minute, I can't believe any of the departments involved want their brands to be permanently associated with a class this badly designed and executed.\n\nThe course material is all over the place, and most of it has little or nothing to do with the ostensible theme of the course. It's like the class is trying to be a mini degree program in its own right instead of teaching students how to visualize data. As a result, of all the classes I've taken at Georgia Tech, I learned the least about actually representing data visually from this one. They need to split this course up -- or at least realize that there are already other courses in the program that teach all the topics it randomly cruises through.\n\nThe workload is so out of control that it seems like this course wasn't built around working professionals but instead around full-time graduate students who are doing nothing this term but taking this class; I've been a full-time graduate student before, and I wouldn't have had time for this course with lab work to do. It's not just that the course design doesn't respect your time; it's rife with open contempt for it. Add to that that the videos provide nearly no information that pertains usefully to any of the assignments. I think you could do the entire course never watching one lecture and never notice a difference in outcomes.\n\nFifty percent of the course grade is a bulky group project, which is all over the place like the rest of the course and adds another big chunk of unclear, aimless, clunky work layered concurrently onto the homework assignments. The project is theoretically constructed as poorly as it is to represent pitching an idea, building it, and communicating progress and outcomes like you would in a real environment, but I work in a real environment, and it doesn't even vaguely resemble this process. I'd be fired if I tried to use this as a template for real work.\n\nThe workload of the assignments wouldn't be as frustrating as it is, I think, if they were at least well put together, but for all that they are often basically checklists, the instructions and the grading schemes still manage to be commonly unclear and sometimes conflicting, both in the written guidance and in communication from instructors. All of the assignments feel like they're in alpha and we're paying them to be testers.\n\nI know other working professionals who are interested in graduate education in data science, and they ask my advice on whether to take this program. To date, I have steered away about $100k in tuition money from Georgia Tech solely because of what an unavoidable train wreck this disaster of a class is. I expect I'll probably steer away maybe $1 mil over the course of the next few years. I like most of the program, but I'm not sinking my co-workers into this morass if I can put up warning signs.",

I would have loved to go into more depth on a couple programs (D3, Tableau, Databricks, etc...)- now I am only at \"Hello World\" proficiency in all of them.  The fourth homework has absolutely nothing related to Data Visualization- its just building a random forest from scratch in python (which you can google and find over 100 tutorials of by yourself).  I spent more time in this class trying to install and configure software than actually learning.  The vast majority of assignment problems are run from the command line or with Powershell.  \n\nHowever, there is a ridiculous amount of extra credit and group work- I averaged ~35% on the homework and somehow got a B overall.",

                        "body": "This was my second course in OMSCS. I've taken a Data Visualization course and a Machine Learning course in undergraduate, and my background is in Statistics. \n\n- **Lectures**: I stopped watching lectures halfway through the course. They're not really related to the assignments and if you manage to find the pdf slides used in on-campus lectures, the quizzes shouldn't be too bad. I'd recommend watching them nonetheless.\n- **Assignments**: The material in DVA was not incredibly difficult for me, but the assignments were tedious and time-consuming. Like many others have mentioned, the assignment require you to learn many different technologies, but merely at a \"complete this tutorial\" level. I'm not so great at planning, but I managed to finish most assignments in a weekend. Assignments are usually due Friday night AOE time, but you get 2 days of grace period for each assignment. Another thing is assignment writeups are subject to change so if you finish the assignment the weekend after it comes out, there's a very real possibility that it's changed at least a little bit before it's due. The changes are usually small but it's annoying to go back and check. \n- **Project**: The project is 50% of your grade, completed in teams of 4-6 people. My team was 4 people since some parts of the project were scaled based on the number of people on your team. It seems like the grading was not so much based on how well your project was done, but more on how well your reports are written, and how much you were able to analyze based on your results. It was easy to forget about the project when there weren't deliverables due that week, and my team wasn't able to complete some of the features we had proposed initially as we ran out of time at the end. \n- **Course staff**: The TAs are very active on Piazza and have a dedicated Slack workspace for office hours. The professor also make posts on Piazza but only for logistical announcements. No complaints here. \n\nFor Spring 2020 specifically there were many adjustments made due to COVID-19, including pushing back due dates/extending grace periods, giving \"wellness points\" to assignments, and canceling the poster presentation part of the project completely. \n\nOverall I had an okay experience in this class. Assignments were annoyingly long sometimes but I did get exposure to a wide variety of tools and technologies. Collaborating with three other people across the US was not easy but we made it work. It's manageable if you plan ahead and spread the work out evenly.",

                        "body": "This is my first course in OMSCS and was the best choice that I could have made. I m out of college for many years now and I could not imagine myself taking exams to start with. So this course fitted perfectly where there were only quizzes worth just 3%. Rest is all coding. So if don't like coding or want to avoid it this course is not for you. In addition to the reviews below, I liked this course for the following reasons\n\n1. There were no ambiguity in any of the HW instructions. The instructions included right from set up to what is expected as part of the solution. If you stick to the instructions to the dot, you are guaranteed with the grade points. It also included test scripts to check folder structure of the final submission so people do not unnecessarily loose points due to mere spelling issues in the file names etc (most of the HWs are auto graded).\n\n2. The rubric was very clear with the project as well. That helped bring together every one in the project team to the same page and quickly get started on. As long as you follow the project guidelines, you are good with scoring points.\n\n3. TAs are very helpful for the most part. I believe each TA takes lead on a question from the HW and spearheads answering questions on the piazza (this is just my observation). All the TAs were on the same page and would refer to the head TA in case of any ambiguity. This was awesome and surprising (as I had read it other way round in the reviews from previous years). They are also extremely helpful in clarifying things and pointing to resources from the course as well as the internet without giving away the answers. All you have to do is open up and feel free to ask questions during office hours (I believe that's where you reap benefits from this program/course)\n\n4. The program was structured a little towards mimicking real world job in terms of group project where you may not expect everyone to contribute equally and still be accountable to deliver in order to gain points. If you end up in a team where members aren't as interested or involved in scoring high then your grade is at a toss for sure (since project accounts for 50%). \n\nThe only thing I did not like with this course is the lectures. They are too basic and high level. If you already know a topic you would appreciate the simple terms that the professor has used to deliver the crux of it. But you cannot really learn from it. I always preferred watching the lectures after submitting the assignment (except for the HW4 where you need to watch the lecture in order to be clear on what is asked in the question) just for taking the quiz. I have heard people were fine with answering the quiz just by googling it but I don't think it will work unless you know the concepts. The references given in the lectures were interesting as opposed to the lecture itself. Don't miss on the reference links.  \n\nSo definitely a great course to take if you like coding, clear rubric and strong TA support. ",

Thankfully, I never submitted a late homework or team deliverable. \n\nHere are some of the personal highlights of the class.\n\n1. Learn about graph data structure. Wow! This was my first exposure to graphs. I can see its application in future professional and personal endeavors. I'm grateful for the opportunity to learn and apply it. The only regret is that we used the Lego data set. I wished we could have applied the homework assignment to LinkedIn, Facebook, or Twitter data set.\n\n2. Learn about SQLite. I have tons of experience with SQL databases: Oracle, MS SQL Server, Apache Derby, MySQL, Sybase.  I've never used SQLite before. What is nice about SQLite database is that it is just a single file.  It also has full text search capability. This feature is what separates it from other SQL databases in my opinion.  Unfortunately, it's support for date is poor but there are work around such as using epoch time.\n\n3. Learn D3.js. I'm a full stack developer with extensive JavaScript programming (React, React Native, jQuery, ECMAScript 2017) . Strangely, I've not used D3.js professionally. It was fun to learn about this library. I love JavaScript coding. It would have been brutal had I not known JavaScript prior to taking this class. You have been warned.\n\n4. Learn Hadoop.  Although I've used Java for over 15 years, I've never written a Hadoop Map Reduce program before. It was fun to learn about it. I knew that Hadoop Map Reduce has been passed over for other libraries but it was fun to understand what it does. \n\n5. Learn Apache Spark and Scala. I spent four weekends prior to this class to learn Spark and Scala. I was able to apply this knowledge to the homework and team project as I was responsible for preparing our team data set. Preparing the data is probably the most time consuming task in a big data project. \n\n6. Learn Microsoft Azure ML Studio. This was one of the homework assignment. Our team had an expert Azure ML and we were able to use this technology on our project.\n\n7. Learn PageRank algorithm. This was very time consuming and difficult. Thankfully, I was able to implement it with massive assistance from videos on the internet. The professor stated that PageRank can be used for any graph data structure. It's not used just for ranking web pages. Thankfully, I caught this information. This algorithm will be nicely added to by technology toolkit for future use.\n\n8. Learn Decision Tree and Rain Forest.  Dang! This was difficult. I think I spent 15 hours on this assignment alone. Like I said, the pain was worth it because I learned a lot. Our implementation must have at least 70% accuracy and finish within 5 minutes. My implementation, as graded by the TA, had an accuracy score of 77% and finished in 1.5 seconds. It is very gratifying to see hard work pay off.\n\n9. Team project. I was very fortunate to be part of a great team. Members stepped up and took on assignments. We had a primary and secondary person for most of our team tasks. We had team members across America and one from Europe. Don't be afraid to work with team members from different time zones. We were able to make it work.  Plus, if you work for a large company, you will have offshore team members. \n\n10. Professor and TA were awesome. They allowed students to help each other. I had one class where TAs would delete student posts if the post was TOO helpful. Thankfully, Professor Chau and the TAs, did not delete many student posts. Thank you for allowing students to help each other. As a suggestion to the students, please help each other if you can. We all have been in situations when we need help. \n\n11. Many extra points. The pain experienced in the class was offset by the many extra points. Thank you professor and TAs.\n\n\nIn conclusion, this class was very time consuming and difficult for me. There were some weeks when I spent 30 hours on the class. It was worth it because I learned a lot and ended up with 97.2% in the class prior to any bonus points.\n\n\n\n",

                        "body": "I was dreading taking this class as it has a reputation of being the most time consuming OMSA course. I think I dreaded it so much and heard such terrible things that somehow it ended up being a little better than I expected. The class grades are based on 50% homework (10% HW1, 15% HW2, 15% HW3, and 10% HW4) and 50% project\n\nHere is my advice:\n\n* Do not take another class with this class. It's a lot of time, as you'll see in the other reviews, so I can't imagine taking it with another class in the same semester\n\n* Do not worry too much about the lectures. They are laughably high-level for the assigned work and you really don't learn much. There are 4 bonus quizzes (worth a bonus 3%)  throughout the course (you get the average of your top 3) that are based on the lectures, but they are open note / open internet. I copied & pasted the transcripts from each lecture into a document so I could CTRL + F during these quizzes. \n\n* Use the entire allotted time for each homework. Many times, it took multiple nights to complete one section of the homework, and each homework had 3-5 sections, so you can't afford to not start right away\n\n* If you can, take this class with friends! I did my undergraduate degree at Georgia Tech and knew some people from that time in this program, so we all took this class in the same semester. It was really really nice to have people to take it with you, not only for the group project, but also for homework support and accountability. We were able to share good resources we found online (since you've thrown into the deep end with the homeworks and aren't given many resources at all by the class lectures) and help each other set up environments & figure out the logistics of these different systems (often that was the more difficult part of the homework, not the coding itself). We could also help troubleshoot each other's work. The homeworks are individual, so you must do your own work, but it is immensely helpful to work alongside someone else. \n\n* One thing that really frustrated me about this class is that not only do they not teach you the skills needed to do the homeworks, they also do not provide any answers to them! You are thrown into the deep end of self-teaching yourself a plethora of new technologies/environments and you never get to see the best way to complete the assignments. You may have written something that technically passes and you receive points for it, but you don't get to see the \"best practice\" way that may have been more efficient. I understand that they don't want current students to be able to see past semesters' answers, but it seems like you never truly finish the learning process. \n\n* For help in this class, there's office hours on slack, an unofficial class slack, and piazza. On piazza, they organize each homework to have one thread per section (sometimes with an additional thread for set-up questions for a section). I understand that they want to have organization and cut down on the amount of questions, but it makes it very difficult to keep up with. You have to scroll through to see what's been added and something people are commenting on early questions so you end up having to read through the gigantic thread multiple times throughout the homework 3 weeks. I personally would have preferred separate threads so I could more easily read about aspects I had questions on. Additionally, with some things being unclear in the homework directions, TAs would make clarifications within these gigantic piazza threads and not always update the homework document to reflect these clarifications which hurt students who had already finished or didn't read through the entire piazza thread. \n\n* Homework 1: This homework consisted of an API assignment, a SQLite assignment (pretty straightforward if you know SQL), an OpenRefine assignment (very easy), and a D3 warm-up. The D3 warm-up was immensely helpful for learning the basics of D3 so you could go right into homework 2 with some knowledge and experience. This homework may give you a false sense of security with the time commitment of this course. \n\n* Homework 2: This homework was 4 intense D3 visualizations as well as a very easy table creation & Tableau chart creation. This homework assignment is infamous as being the most time consuming you'll have and it lives up to it.\n\n* Homework 3: Just when you think you're past the worst of the semester, this homework is assigned - don't underestimate it. For us, it included an AWS problem, two Hadoop/Java problems (VERY difficult), a Spark/Scala problem on Databricks (pretty easy), and an Azure ML Studio problem (very easy). \n\n* Homework 4: Also don't underestimate this homework assignment - it only has 3 parts and they're all in python (yay!) but it was a random forest from scratch (very difficult), a pagerank problem (difficult), and a scikit-learn package jupyter notebook (pretty straightforward)\n\n* Project: Would very much recommend finding a team in your time zone, if not a team in your location you can meet up with in person. You could use any technology in this project so our team used Tableau since we had experienced people and that was lovely to be able to do (MUCH easier than D3). Pick an interesting topic since you'll be working on this project throughout the semester. And finally read the rubrics thoroughly - they don't give you many pages to fit all information you have to give and it's also easy to leave things out, so double check you've fulfilled all the requirements.",

The class is largely self-directed learning which is disappointing given that we are paying to be taught concepts, but you would be just as well off without any of the class material.\n\nThe class consists of two portions worth 50% of the grade each:\n\n* Homework\n\n    * There are a total of 4 homeworks, each covering a wide array of programming languages and CS concepts including mapreduce, D3, HTML, CSS, Python, Scala, SQL, Pig, Hive, AWS, Azure, OOP and Java to name a few.\n\n    * The lecture videos cover topics at a very high level and offer no appreciable help in solving the homework problems.\n\n    * The answers to the homework problems are not published, so if you miss a question you will never get to know exactly what you missed or know the proper solution. This part is especially troubling to me as the class is self-directed and I ended up producing answers that were acceptable but that I knew were not necessarily the correct or best way to solve the problem. This creates a situation where I now \"know\" how to solve certain problems, but that these solutions would not be acceptable in my career making these exercises pointless. \n\n    * Arbitrary grading policies where you will be deducted points for items that were not explicitly detailed or explained.\n\n    * Posting on Piazza is a waste of time as posts usually go unanswered for days at a time and deadlines can be quite tight especially when project items can be due at the same time. I had one post go unacknowledged for 10 days. When posts are answered the feedback is often unhelpful with responses like \"Watch the video\" or \"Read the tutorial\" being the default.\n\n* Class project\n\n    * Typical problems of class projects that were amplified by the fact that this is an online program.\n\n    * Grading criteria is ambiguous and no examples are made available. \n\n    * More arbitrary grading with no actionable insights or feedback. There are various checkpoints where you must submit pieces of the project for grading and my team was deducted points with feedback like \"Would have liked a little more explanation\" without noting which section the comment was applicable to.\n\n    * One big problem with the project is that the drop deadline is late in the semester after teams are formed and we had members drop right before the deadline making much of our planning moot.\n\nUltimately this class was extremely disappointing for me as I had been looking forward to it because my work requires creation of many visualizations. This class has provided me with no applicable skills that I can use moving forward in this program or in my career. Since this is a required class my advice to anyone needing to take it is to get into the Slack ASAP. For reference, I got an A in the course and have 5 years industry experience.",

I registered this course after reading the on campus syllabus (My bad), when I saw the OMS syllabus, it was too late to withdraw and waitlist another course, so I decide to take it. The on campus version included all modern technologies SQL, Tableau, D3, Hadoop, Azure, Hbase, Pagerank etc.. But the OMS version is basically week 1-6: intro to R and ggplot in R; week 7 till end: regressions in R. The syllabus speaks for itself, a more appropriate name should be \"intro to regression with R\" or \"the linear regression half of stat 101\". These knowledge might be useful 10 years ago when everything was analyzed in memory, but now... I'm almost to the end of this semester, I've completed most of the homework/project in slow Friday afternoons at work without watching the videos. I have a statistical background, but to be honest, the course (homework) covered nothing more than linear regression, I assume most of us coming to the program should have some knowledge of linear regression. \n\n The only scenarios I think you should take this class:\n 1. you need a low involvement course: eg. you are paring it with an intensive 30+ hour course.  \n 2. (more important) if you are in the Machine Learning specialization, you have to chose 3 electives from the 4 courses offered. If you have one course you don't want (eg. BD4H), you'll have to take all the rest of the 3.",

I did spend a ton of time completing the homework assignments, but I always started them as early as I can, and I spread out the effort into multiple days. Maybe the total hours spent were large, since I started so early, I never had to stay up late. \nMany people complaint about the second homework, which is visualizations with D3. However, I found that interesting and enjoyed it. My hours spent on the four assignments were about 15 hrs, 25 hrs, 15 hrs, 10 hrs.\n\nIt is also important that you find a good team, like many other reviews mentioned. That can really determines your experience at this course. I was really lucky that I was in a nice team. Everyone was working hard and each of us has different specialties and contributed to the project. I don't think any of us had to spend more than 20 - 30 hours for the project.\n\nI finished with very high score in this class, but I don't feel I learnt as much. For example, the third homework was about big data tools, such as AWS, Hadoop, Azure, Hive, Pig, etc. Yes, I finished the homework and got full points, but I don't feel I know much about them and even confident enough to put them on my resume. \n\nI agree with many others that this class is trying to fit in too many things. They should remove some and just focus on a few and get deeper in them. That way I think we will learn more."

You're expected to work, a LOT!\n\nFor the team project, I think I was lucky I had an amazing teammate! We started four people on the team which is the minimum number of students to form a group and ended up two halfway through the project (the other two had dropped). \nMy advice here is that you do your part and try to engage all members of the team.\n \nThe video presentation is a good learning experience because It forces you to really experience how much effort goes into preparing and delivering a presentation to communicate data via good story telling.\n\nThe course material is well structured and thought out. The professor and TAs are engaged and helpful despite the insane number of students in this class (over 1000 between on-campus and online).\n\nIf you're pursuing a career in Data Science or Data Engineering you should take this class!"

Now I can credibly say that I'm comfortable with Hadoop, Spark, Pig, d3. Also, I thought the content of the homework assignments was great. They encouraged a lot of independent research, but not so much that it was unwieldy.\n\nNext, the bad. \nPersonally, I found the video lectures pretty lacking. They were almost absurdly high-level compared to how in the weeds homework got. \nAlso, I just really hated the group project. My team did well, but it was just so difficult to coordinate in a program like this where students have a lot of different lifestyles and everything was obviously remote. Further, we divided up the work in such a way that each person focused only on one domain. So this may have been a good approximation of the workplace, but I just didn't feel that was necessary. Really, I'd prefer to just have a 5th assignment.\nAlso, the first drafts of the homework assignments were <i>rough</i>. It was commonplace that TAs would post updated versions a week after an assignment opened. Or they would post clarifications in Piazza, but you'd need to sift through hundreds of comments to find that. You would be almost penalized by trying to work on homework early, because they would clear up poor instructions later.",

This was a class I had wanted to take even prior to joining the program, and the previous bad reviews didn't change my stance. I wish I had listened to all the bad reviews. \n\nThe only thing I learned was to hate all the technologies it introduced. The lectures are garbage, very high level, with no help for the homeworks. The TAs are not at all responsive to Piazza posts. It's actually very hard to work on the project at the same time as the homeworks, because the homeworks take over your life. The test cases for the homeworks are very poor, so it's impossible to figure out if you're going to get docked points. The instructions for everything are unclear and poorly written. The final project and all it's associated work was due the weekend of Thanksgiving, in a giant middle finger to a majority of students. \n\nI'm sitting at an A before the final project and I still regret taking this.",

The professor is very strict about the HW submissions, and if like me you upload the wrong ZIP file you will get 0%. Considering that there are only 4 HWs and they contribute 10-15% of your grade, well - there goes your A. Coming from a non-CS background I found the HWs very challenging. The project itself was not hard for me; I had already taken Regression and have on-the-job experience in Tableau. I did however, have to hustle, and take a couple of days off work to make sure the group project got a 100% and I passed the class.

                        "body": "This is by far one of my favorite classes as well as being one that required a fair amount of work and effort. There are 4 main homework assignments that make up half your grade. If you are super familiar with each of the technologies used in the assignment you'll find that particular assignment easier then others. For example, the last assignment was based on python and I fairly good at python so it was less work than figuring out numerous homework problems in D3 (a JavaScript library). These definitely take a fair amount of time to complete each one. The final project is decent amount of work, however it seems to be graded pretty fairly and in alignment with the rubric (which can be vague to some degree). As long as you pick and interesting final / team project, find sufficient data, perform a complete operation to compute a value and present that information in a nice graphical way, you'll be fine. The rest of the final / team project is just paperwork around that. Time intensive but not complicated. The homeworks and projects make up your grade with the four homeworks totaling 50% and the project 50%. There aren't aren't any tests, but there are chances for a few bonus points by taking quizzes. There are 4 of such quizzes and the best three form your bonus points. The course covers a wide variety of data analysis topics, from the best way to present data, how to process larges amounts of data locally and using (outdated) tools such as Hadoop and (more modern) tools like EC2 and compute engines on AWS and Azure. There are even homework problems about scraping data from the web using APIs. You'll also learn some python along the way. There is no R in this class for the assignments though you can certainly could use it if you wanted for your final project. Don't watch the videos they don't add any value. There is room for this course to grow. The videos for a starter. Some people will complain about there being too much work or that tries to do too much, but that's the point. There is a lot to the world of data science and data analytics. There are many tools to use and many factors to consider. There isn't a single data scientist out there who just crunches number on a python jupyter notebook all day and claps theirs hands and is done. Stick with the course. Lots of work but you can make it through.",

Save yourself the time and do this d3.js tutorial, https://d3js.org/#introduction, and watch these videos on making nice charts: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGsVd_SJ2YA\n\nSave yourself the frustration of way-too-large homework requirement documents where the TAs and professor at first simply refuse to clarify any further. When they do, they can be smug or just take so long to clarify that you'll possibly jeopardize your assignment (since some take hours or days to run).\n\nNot only is the workload so severely miscalibrated, but the course is staggeringly off-topic. You won't learn about data analytics as you might professionally understand them. The course should have simply been called Data Visualization, or \"How to use d3.js and some other misc CS stuff\". We spent 2 weeks building a Decision Tree... for a Data Analytics course. This would make sense... if I were taking a Machine Learning or AI course. Why did the professor have us spend 2 weeks writing a decision tree in python for a data visualization and analytics class? The problem is the class doesn't know what it's trying to be. Unclear why the professor has you work your butt off, presumably so he can claim he runs a tough course?\n\nNote, this review comes from someone who got an A in the course, has a 4.0 GPA, and has 7+ years of industry experience. My frustration stems from having wasted so much time. SO, so, so much time--for months. I'm in this program to genuinely learn and this course had me run a gauntlet while learning nothing at all. Do not take it. The course makes the OMS program weaker, not stronger. I spent such a large amount of time each week in this course on such trivial meaningless tasks, that I was severely burned out by the end. And, after all is said and done, a group project worth 50% of your grade? You'll be submitting two peices of work in the final week that's worth 25% and 7.5% of your course grade. That's a whopping 32.5%, and you won't be given a chance to request a regrade. Good luck hoping you get a hard-working group and diligent TAs.\n\nAfter working myself to exhaustion, the best things I learned were: how to use d3.js (a javascript library) and how to select colors well when making a bar chart. I took the course so I could fill a data analytics niche at my company and walked away knowing as much as I entered with. If you take this course, say so long to 4 months you could have spent learning useful skills.\n\nIf you like to learn, like I do, I highly recommend Machine Learning 4 Trading (medium difficulty), or High Performance Computer Architecture (high difficulty). Those were **outstanding** courses and show how the OMSCS can really shine.",

Transitioned from Software Test Engineer to more Software Development during this phase of taking this course, full time job. Knowing a bit of Python helped a little on some of the homework.\nCourses taken so far were:\n- GIOS Spring2018\n- SAD Summer2018\n- SAT & SDP Fall2018\n\nClasses taken concurrently with this class:\nCN & DB\nI would say by now I have gotten the hang of the program and how it works, so I knew my abilities and what I needed to do.\n\n<b>Summary</b>\n\nGreat class with a lot of breadth in learning big data technology. Lots of D3 JavaScript. Homework assignments take a good amount of time, especially HW2 that was focused on D3, but they are a lot of fun. Make sure to find a good team for group project because it can be really great where you learn a lot from others and build an awesome project, or really shitty where no one knows how to do anything and you gotta carry your team. Even if you have to carry the team, you can make a pretty simple/easy project and still get a very good grade, think as long as you submit something and paper is decently well written/follow all requirements.\n\n<b>Pros</b>\n- NO TESTS\n- Interesting and important subjects\n- Homeworks are very engaging and fun, well guided\n- Lots of breadth so you have a pretty good idea of what something is or how it works when brought up in conversation/interview\n- Easy A if you are diligent to do all the homework and your group does not fail you\n\n<b>Cons</b>\n- Can take up a lot of time\n- Possibility of needing to carry your team in group project since the class is combined with OMSA, so suggestion is to find a good team :)\n\n<b>Tips</b>\n- Start homework early. Keep an eye out on piazza because people post the same questiosn and answers which you will most likely also have/need.\n- Try not to get a group with OMSA students :)\n- Not recommended to take 3 classes with full time job :D",

Difficulty is very front loaded, with HW1 and especially HW2 taking huge amounts of time, while 3 didn't take long and I was able to complete 4 in a single dedicated afternoon. I put my average workload (including project) as 15, but really it was more like 20 for the first half and 10 for the second. I tend to finish assignments quicker than average though, so I would prepare to require as much as 25-30 hours of work on some weeks depending on your knack for general programming and quickly picking up new libraries and software with little direction. Lectures rarely provide more info than an appetizer for what you'll need to teach yourself, so I generally did not keep up with them.\n\nThe real meat of the class in the group project. If you have a good team with a complementary skill set it can be alright, but I could imagine things getting tough with a suboptimal group. Make sure your team has at least one skilled writer and larger groups can actually make things harder on you since word limits are strict and each member needs to contribute 3 unique pieces of related literature for the survey portion.\n\nGrades are very generous. Assignment grades average high B's and project related assignments had a large majority of A's. There are also multiple opportunities for extra credit and the instructor lowered letter grade cutoffs by 2%. If you can handle the time commitment it shouldn't be too hard to land a decent grade.",

Others in the course had issues with communication but I did not have any trouble with it. \n\nThere's also a large course project to complete in teams of 4-6 people, mine went great and I was happy with the team and our results. If you get a lousy group then you might have a very different experience, so make sure to be proactive early in the course and secure a spot with a dependable team.\n\nAlthough the homework assignments and course project were very time-consuming, there are no exams, and grading was extremely generous.

Only one assignment delves into any depth on something to the point that you feel you could actually build something halfway interesting on your own (D3.js in the second assignment). The other assignments are more or less \"go do a basic tutorial on [some hot tech that shows up in job requirements], but change one of the parameters so that it feels like you aren't just doing a tutorial.\n\nMany of the assignment questions give instructions at the detail of \"click this button to set this parameter. Then, scroll down and click Run...\" At the end, sure, you've run a map-reduce or whatever, but you don't actually know how or why you did it besides to finish the assignment. I don't really feel like I could say anything meaningful about Spark, for example, other than it lets you work with big data.\n\nThe instructor mentions the philosophy of the assignments is to teach you to quickly pick up different technologies, but the problem is you don't actually pick up any of them. Running through a tutorial that tells you every single parameter to set isn't picking up a technology. It's just running through the motions.\n\nAll this said, the D3 stuff was interesting. I made a couple of cool graphs. If I do a personal project down the line, I might use D3 for something because it's really nice to be able to show something visual.\n\nDoes this mean you shouldn't take the class? I don't know. It just is frustrating in some respects. I wouldn't take it if you are not a ML-spec though. Even if you are, I'd think twice about it.",

There's a lot of potential in this class that was just not realized in the Spring 2019 semester.\n\nHere's the breakdown:\n\nThe GOOD: There is significant exposure to a variety of technologies across the board, from machine learning/cloud cluster computing in Azure and AWS/etc. (the aforementioned \"Data Analytics\" part of the course) to data visualization with d3/Tableau/etc. (the aforementioned \"Data Visualization\" part of the course). After doing all of the homeworks, you can probably understand what it's doing under the hood and not sound like an idiot when questioned about why it's on your resume under the skills section.\n\nThe BAD: This was a beast of a course that simply tries to do too much - the course title is \"Data Visualization and Analytics\", but has elements of \"Data Visualization\" and \"Data Analytics\" and four massive homeworks trying to accomplish both. The end result is a Frankenstein's Monster of homework problems each taking 5-10 hours introducing completely different concepts. \n\nThe course does so much that you get one homework problem worth of understanding, but then immediately pivot over to something new and you'll never use the previous question's concept EVER again. \n\nThe lectures are good for nothing except for about 3% of your grade, and they're extra credit. They're short and interesting enough, but google is more helpful than the lectures.\n\nThe UGLY: 4 homeworks AND a group project. The total time commitment would have been roughly 200-250 hours over 4 months, depending on the time spent for homework and project. Obviously if you are an ace coder, the amount drops significantly. However, with just CSE-6040 and some basic coding chops, the estimate is fairly accurate.",

They each consist of around 15+ pages of config/setup instructions, and multiple multi-part questions, each of which links to more pages of instructions on setup. There is nothing intellectually hard (some of the homeworks are literally to just do the tutorials on AWS or Azure), but getting the configuration set up and copying/pasting the correct commands in the right order is frustrating, and then working through the vast and confusing/conflicting grading rubrics takes a long time. The homeworks are very superficial, and cover a lot of buzzwords. I honestly can't even remember the names of all the technologies we were meant to have learnt, but I now know enough to say that Pig, Hive, Hadoop (and maybe something called Spark?) are *something* to do with big data. There you go - you've just learnt as much as I did over the course of the semester, that's a freebie. \n\nThe group project is not fun. The guidance is minimal (\"go and create something that uses a lot of data and has an interactive visualization, no we can't give you any examples\"), and obviously it's a *group project*. It seems that the professor is attempting to squeeze the on-campus format of the course into the online version, but a group project just doesn't fit the online offering very well. Your experience will depend highly on playing chicken to see which member of your team actually does the project - if it's you, then be prepared to put in a lot of work. If it's someone else then congratulations, you get 50% of your grade for free.\n\nThis course could be great if the group project were removed, the homeworks restructured to be more focused, the curriculum updated (removing d3 and maybe Hadoop), and the lectures lengthened and improved.",

I think that Polo is a good high level lecturer and that the homework assignments are well designed and offer clear direction. \n\nI don't really agree with having the final project count for half of your class grade since it might only incorporate a few elements of what we learn from homework/lectures. I will warn that managing the project on top of homework can be stressful. Plan ahead.\n\nHomework on average took me sometime between 25 and 35 hours each. We have about three weeks for each assignments, so time dedicated to homework is roughly 10 hours a week with a good degree of fluctuation.",

Boy, was that a mistake.\n\nThere are four homeworks, each counting 12.5% towards the final grade, and one group project, which counts for 50%. The homeworks are the most tedious assignments I have ever had the displeasure of having to do. The descriptions are generally 8 or 9 pages long, with 4 or 5 \"questions\". For each question you need to start completely from scratch, and it often involves spending hours setting up an environment in order to tweak two or three lines of code. It's a bit like they cobbled together 30 different online tutorials, and make you recreate all of them. There is 0 creativity in the homeworks; you just have to mindlessly follow instructions for hours on end. Out of the 20 hours I spent on each project,  around 10 minutes was spent actually doing something interesting (like writing a map reduce algorithm). The rest was setting up environments or following mundane instructions to the letter, so as to not lose points.\n\nThe lectures also don't save this course: they have very little substance, cannot be downloaded for offline viewing, and help next to nothing with 99% of the tasks and projects. You may as well not watch them.\n\nAs for the group project, well, that depends on the group you end up with. I enjoyed that part of the course. At least it required some creativity!",

I was taking another class at the same time but spent most of my time on this one.  If you don't have a computer science background or are not familiar with many of computer languages and environments, it's going to be a very time-consuming course.\n\nIt had only four homework assignments and a group project, no exams.  It did provide 4 short (10 minutes) and easy bonus quizzes (top 3 used) to improve the final grade (worth 1% point each).  So at least we didn't spend time preparing for exams, which often don't help us learn or assess our learning. \n\nThe professor was very engaging and deeply cared about the course and students.  He was very responsive and communicated personally to students.  The TAs are generally good and but some were not responsive.  There were 500 students in the class.  They did a good job organizing questions and responding to questions on Piazza.  It was a continuous improvement process -- things were getting refined during the course.  Obviously, the professor and TAs put a lot of effort into the course, which I appreciate. \n\nThe homework instructions were ~ 15 pages long and included links to additional instructions or online resources.  So much of the learning was outside the edX video but reading materials in the homework.  Much time was spent understanding the homework requirements and setting up the accounts, environments etc.   There were many assumptions as what you already knew.  So if you were really new to the material or concepts, you could be lost and would have to look up information elsewhere, which was very time-consuming and frustrating, especially when the instructions were not well written and the TAs were not responsive. \n\nThe problems were not hard.  But setting up the environment and learning the basic of a new language or tool took much of the time.  So we got a taste of many things but would need more practice to feel confident about our skills.  If they split the course into two or more topics, we could go deeper.  But I understand the compromise. \n\nThe project was not too hard, at least for my team who were very engaged and skilled.  There was a lot of work, not enough time.  It took a while for us to decide on the topic and scope. There were too many specific requirements for the project, similar to writing a research project proposal and paper.  While I see the value of the requirements, it's not realistic to truly benefit from them in a short period of time.  The grading of the project was generous, especially for the final report.   I would recommend reducing the weight of the project from 50% of the course grade to maybe 30% with a correspondingly smaller scope and fewer requirements.  \n\nOverall, despite the issues, I learned a lot and liked the course.  However, if the homework instructions were better written, I could learned the same with far less time.",

Fortunately, there are no exams (aside from some bonus quizzes, which count for a bit of extra credit), but there was a very large group project that took up 50% of the grade. Because the class was combined with the OMSA program, there were a lot of students and the TA's felt very busy and would often be difficult to get a hold of to ask questions.

There are some good tips for the latter, but still most of the time is spent setting up environments and not learning anything really useful.\n\nThey also want you to from a group, come up with an idea, and decide which technologies you will use within a very short timeframe.

                        "body": "Please note that this is a review for the \"new\" DVA course which is shared between OMSA and OMSCS starting Fall 2018.\n\nIf you are a first semester student, read this review thoroughly to understand what you are getting into - in this course, if you do not stay on the ball, you would be thrown for a spin.\n\nLet's begin with the facts of the course. This should answer some commonly asked questions.\n\n- True to its name, the course covers visualization of data and big data analytics\n- On the conceptual end, it covers aspects of human-computer interaction (HCI) relevant to visualizing data, Data Cleaning, Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, Graph Analytics and Text Analytics. The material is not very mathematical. So, brushing up on math is not a prerequisite\n- On the technical end, you would use D3.js, Hadoop (HDFS, Pig and Hive), Spark, Python (not R) and several other tools\n- Professor Chau was very involved and easily accessible via Piazza throughout the class\n- The TA'ing was very good - if you ignore a hiccup here and there, it was top notch\n- 50% of the grade is homeworks while the other 50% is the group project. There are quizzes for 3% extra credit. There are no exams\n- You get 3 weeks to finish and submit each homework. There are 3 weeks for the project final report at the end but the project runs in parallel with everything with deliverables spread throughout the semester\n- There are several office hours spread across the week and are conducted on Slack\n- Project teams are 4-6 people (larger teams with permission) and self-selected. Aim for the higher number since many teams end up with 2-3 people due to withdrawals and that can result in a lot of work.  Your team can have people from both OMSCS and OMSA.\n\nNow for my opinion of the course. The course is very well organized and a must-take for anyone doing the ML specialization. The lectures are informative and the assignments are designed to give you practical experience in what you are learning, though assignments do not cover everything learned. Note that lectures are only available to OMSCS students on Canvas which means you cannot access them before the start of semester.\n\nThe difficulty of this course comes, not from complexity but,  from the amount of work you are required to do. The key to succeed is to start every assignment early - every homework has a lot of setup steps and each question can require you to learn something new. For example, for a single homework, you are expected to learn Hadoop HDFS, Pig, Hive, Spark Dataframes, Azure and AWS etc. within a 3 week period - in addition to the lectures and project work. If you cannot ramp up your knowledge fast enough, this course is not for you.\n\nD3.js merits its own section. IMHO it is poorly documented and that adds to the amount of work you need to put in. The Scott Murray tutorial is a nice beginning but takes you nowhere near the complexity you face in the assignments. If you do not have prior experience working with HTML and Javascript\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010\u0010, it adds to the misery.

                        "body": "### Overall, a great course! Glad they changed to the \"new\" format...\n\nMy first course in OMSCS.\n\nThis course was challenging in that it required learning a plethora of new languages, frameworks, and tools in a short amount of time. Some students may see this as negative; I chose to see this as positive, equipping me for the \"real world\" where I will get thrust into situations where I don't have a TA to hand me an answer...\n\nThis course was also challenging because of the group project. We started with 5 members; 3 dropped the class and we completed the project with 2! But we survived. Towards the end of semester, it seems the TA's got lazy and gave almost everyone 100% on the final report (worth 25% of the grade!!!), as the **mean** score was 97.7%....choose your group members wisely and do not select an English undergrad to be in your group (lesson learned...)\n\nI was frustrated a bit with the amount of hand-holding in this class...students complaining about how \"hard\" it is to learn all these new languages. Well...this is a *Master's* program!! The reason this frustrates me is that it totally devalues my Master's degree if anyone can come in, have their hand held through the entire degree, and be awarded at the end. Ok, rant over.\n\nMost of the HW was easy, just time-consuming with a lot to do, lots of i's to dot and t's to cross...HW's are moving targets with requirements changing daily based on student questions or debates over ambiguity. Nevertheless, there is a LOT of boilerplate, template code where all you have to do is \"fill in the blanks\"...ah memories of undergrad freshman programming classes... ;)\n\nToggl Time Report: https://goo.gl/L3DC9Y\n\nEach HW is granted **3 weeks** to complete... plenty of time if you START RIGHT AWAY. Seriously. Start right away. Just not the day it is released.. start a couple of days after it's released so that rather than wasting your time with kinks that weren't figured out, you can come to Piazza and observe all your most pressings questions asked and hopefully answered.\n\n#### Time consumed and topics covered/tools & languages used:\nHW1: https://goo.gl/vCHHCG\n29 hours\n* Python/APIs\n* Gephi/graph viz\n* SQLite\n* Javascript & D3 Intro\n* OpenRefine\n\nHW2: https://goo.gl/7oNpHs\n35 hours (longest). If you don't know Javascript before coming into this class, you're gonna have a HARD time on this HW. I am quite familiar w/ Javascript (I would rate myself 4/5 on expertise) and you can see how long it took me.\n* Tableau\n* D3, D3, and more D3! (loved learning D3...very powerful and useful library)\n\nHW3: https://goo.gl/uaAxb3\n24 hours (shortest). The TA's did an excellent job providing lots of guides on how to get up and running with AWS, Azure, etc. All I can say is USE A MAC! It will make your life MUCH EASIER!!! ssh...scp...etc. Also, spend time and dig in...LEARN how to use these tools, don't just complain it is being dumped on you\n* Intro to Hadoop (very simple algorithm). 1 Question run on a pre-config'd VM, 1 Question run on Azure\n* Intro to Spark (again, very elementary algorithm). Run on Cloudbricks cloud-based env...almost 0 setup\n* Intro to Pig... very easy to pick up..Google and the class slides are your friend.\n* Azure ML studio...almost not worth mentioning. Beyond easy. Follow a tutorial...\n\nHW4: https://goo.gl/hjVwdu\n25.5 hours (one of the most challenging). I had 0 ML experience coming into this class, which would explain why this HW was the most difficult for me. If you're familiar w/ sklearn & numpy it will be easier. Still...questions were quite lenient in retrospect, lots of pre-baked template code where you fill in the blanks.\n* warmup exercise w/ mmap (fill in the blanks to pack/unpack binary files)\n* build a Decision Tree Random Forest in Python from scratch (this was the challenging part, without any guidance or algorithm...all I can say is Google ;) )\n* sklearn to test different ML algs and report accuracies\n\nNo exams, thank goodness!",

I have a full time job, family, etc. My background is NOT in development which is one of the reasons I chose this course as I wanted to get my feet wet with data and its manipulation. I found the course very difficult but really liked it. I'm expecting to safely pull away with an A.\n\nThe professor and TAs were great. They hold regular office hours. Grading is fair (but follow the rubric to the letter!)\n\nYou touch on so many really cool technologies, especially those that look good on a resume - Hadoop, Spark, Azure, AWS, PIG, Tableau, even a touch of machine learning at the end. But as others have mentioned you don't get to know any of them really well. Dr. Polo obviously knows what he's talking about and you can tell he's passionate about this stuff. Unfortunately, the lectures are really high level and are little help when you're actually doing the homework. They were helpful though for the bonus quizzes which seemed to come straight from the lectures.\n\nThere are no tests but the group project is a lot of work with a lot of deliverables. I was lucky and had a great group which helped a lot.\n\nIf I had it to do over again I would:\n\t<ul>\n<li>Prep for the class by becoming friends with D3, javascript and DOM concepts</li>\n<li>Start the assignments early!</li>\n<li>I personally would have a tutor on standby. Since my day job is not as a developer, there were times I really struggled with programming concepts that could likely easily be explained in a 30 minute sit down. Trying to have that \"sit down\" over Piazza posts or Slack office hours when you're not even sure what your question is is difficult.</li>\n<li>Be extremely detailed when reading the homework assignments. Unfortunately you don't get rubric in the form of a checklist. It's buried across the several paragraphs of the homework questions themselves.</li>\n<li>Piazza. I learned late in the game that Piazza cannot be treated as the place to go when *I* want to ask a question. It really needs to be treated like the class textbook where you go regularly to read. Just read. Because if you don't read through all the posts that you don't care about, you'll miss the 1 post where they mention you're not allowed to use that library in your homework that you just used last night. Or another where they mention an easy approach to the thing you've been struggling with for 10 hours.</li>\n</ul>",

The class syllabus is changed from Fall 2018 and it's not the same old DVA which used R programming. There are quite a lot of skills to learn in this class from D3, Azure, AWS, Hadoop, Pig, Spark etc in 4 assignments. The homework is pretty good and gives good insight into using these modern tools and technologies. There is a group project worth 50% of the weight. I was hesitant to take this class because of this group project. We did a decent project for visualization and though it was not great collaboration and typical team collaboration issues. However, the scores we got for group projects were pretty lenient and expecting an A and I am sure the majority of the class got excellent scores with group projects. I am sure, Prof Polo and TAs want everyone to succeed in this class and overall it was a good learning experience for me.",

These changes can range from trivial (adding a line of code) to non-trivial (implement an algorithm and necessary data structures within a predefined framework).\n\nAs a result, the course is heavily weighted towards breadth over depth. You probably get the most depth out of D3/javascript with almost an entire assignment dedicated to it, but for most other languages covered, you are barely scratching the surface, which is rather unfortunate.\n\nMost of the assignments are not conceptually all that difficult, but working through the environment setup and figuring out the logic of the frameworks can be quite tedious. The group project of course is not suited to the online experience. You have to hope you luck out with a decent group that will share the work. You'll basically want to get enough technical expertise within your group to cover the scope of building a data driven web app.\n\nThe teaching staff and TA's are responsive and engaged, which is great.\n\nUltimately, the course is alright, but I didn't really care for the survey nature of it, especially with so much time dedicated to environment setup.

However, the stated purpose of the course is to give a breadth of exposure to many facets of a data science project, and I think it does that well. \n\nMost of the homework assignments could be best described as completing \"hello world\" in whatever tool is being presented (e.g. D3.js, SQLite, Hadoop/Mapreduce, Spark, scikit-learn, virtual memory, etc). The point is to make you aware of what all these tools are, and when you should consider using them. I appreciated that framework as I worked the group project, as I knew roughly what I needed to use and taught myself more depth as needed. \n\nI spent a lot more time than I wanted to on the group project, but it did force me to learn a lot and start grappling with open-ended and messy data science work outside the clean environment of toy problems typically encountered in an academic course. It's motivated me to carve out more time next semester to work Kaggle/open data problems because I learned so many things that I could not be taught in a lecture through diving into the project.",

On the other hand, the group project was a massive pain in the ass, and I don't really understand the rationale for doing a group project in an online distributed graduate program. In particular it was quite challenging when certain group members contributed variable amounts to the project, and I ended up feeling like our project frankly would have been better done by one or two people - at higher quality, likely less total time, and certainly less stress than was achieved by doing it in a group.\n\nAt times I felt like Polo, the professor this term, was being super arbitrary in his interpretation of various rules and policies. Additionally, one ding on the homework assignments is that they required lots of environment configuration time, particularly relative to the actual core concepts. On one homework, I probably spent several hours configuring the cloud environment to run my MapReduce code, which I had written in something like < 5 minutes. Very very tedious and not that fun.\n\nOverall I wouldn't advise people to stay away from this course, but would certainly have them going in with eyes open. The homework assignments can take a long time if you don't go in with a great handle on JavaScript, and the group project is no fun. But it's an okay course overall, and I'm sure there are far worse in the program (at least the teaching team is engaged and seems to care quite a lot)."

Some people who are relatively \"green\" will suffer long hours of struggling. Many people lost points because they didn't read the assignment text carefully enough. \n\nI went in knowing really only python and a little bit of SQL, and I did well in the class. The projects don't really go too in depth and provide usually only a cursory look at each technology/tool - though that's usually enough to get you going on more complicated pursuits. Note that you'll need to set up an AWS & Azure account using a credit card.\n\nBe aware that the group project is 50% of the grade and intermediate deliverables are due throughout the semester. If you are bad with time management, and/or dislike group projects - you should stay far away from this course. We had a passable group of partners (they recommend 4-6), but some groups had complete meltdowns where the majority of the group dropped out of the course or just decided not to participate anymore - which is standard stuff for any OMSCS group project class. Also, if you dislike web development work, the largest project in this class is a d3.js project that takes a relative large chunk of time.\n\nAside from these caveats, I greatly enjoyed the class and got quite a lot out of it.

                        "body": "This class is A LOT like boiling water. \n\nPicture if you will: Each question for each HW (~4 questions per HW, for 4 HWs) is like heating up a big pot of water. It takes a lot of energy and effort for each question to come to the correct answer (setting up software/coding environments, learning many different coding languages on the fly, constantly checking Piazza 24/7 for TA corrections/clarifications and adjusting your code to reflect these changes, etc). \n\nBy the time you (sort of) figure out what you are doing and have all these moving pieces working together to get the correct answer and start making steam, you take that massive pot of saturated water with a ton of latent energy that you baked into it over 10-20 hours, AND THEN YOU DUMP IT DOWN THE DRAIN AND START ALL OVER FOR THE NEXT QUESTION. BWAHAHAHAHAHAHA. \n\nRinse and repeat this over another dozen times or so and this is DVA. By the way, this doesn't include the team Project which is also adds another 100 hours to the course. \n\nSeriously, the course really needs to focus on a sub portion of all the materials it discusses, and less on busy work. Really, I think the course could focus almost entirely on HW2 (which is Javascipt, d3, HTML, CSS) and still be a pretty work intensive course if you know very little about front end web programming (which seemed to be the case for most the class). At least then I would have the confidence to be able to place those concentrated skills on my resume. As the class stands now, I touched so many things at once at such a high level, I really can't talk about them at an SME level within an interview. \n\nThis asks a basic but very critical question for the future design of the course: In terms of my career and the ability to market skills gained from this class, have I really gotten anywhere 300 hours later?",

I work with data and found the material very easy yet unnecessarily time-consuming (read: busywork) and learned little from lectures or homework. I picked a project I was interested in for my group and got some value out of this (doing most of the work myself, as these things go). \n- Lectures are very high-level and brief \n- Homeworks are either extremely detailed (D3.js - legend three px to left, etc) or all over the place (hello world on AWS & Azure using five different tools). With prior experience, they take 1-2 days at most and are an easy A with some attention to detail. The downside is, of course, you'll also not learn much. Without experience, you may spend several days on each project to climb up the learning curves without really getting very far. \n- The group project should bring everything together but student backgrounds are diverse so it's worth selecting a group carefully. Lots of people dropped half-way through.\n\nIf you want to dive deep into data science and spend time on an ambitious project, the course gives you a platform. However, there's a substantial risk that you end up wondering, as I do, what the point of this class is.",

                        "body": "I don't know if the average workload per week indicated on this database is being skewed based on historical data collected from the time it had a different professor, or a natural tendency for people to report less effort than they actually put in hoping to look smarter, or I put in way more work than I needed to for the class, or a combination of all three. The fact of the matter though is that I respectfully disagree with the 12 hours/week of effort average number. I just exchanged some notes with another student (an awesome one none less), and his opinion about the course is very much aligned with mine.\n\nFirst half is dedicated to learning the basics of R, which made the workload per week reasonably in line with the 12 hours reported to date (assuming you never saw R in your life, like I hadn't at the time). However, the second half seemed to be a race to the finish line with a lot packed in juts a few weeks (at least for me). The actual specific subject of the class is all presented on the second half, and the fact I took the class on the Summer semester certainly didn't help the cause. I felt I have put in 30+ hours (especially on the projects) per week on the second half of the course and still felt I could have delivered a better work product at the end. \n\nI suppose that, since this is a Master's degree course, one gets what one puts into any class and I can attest I learned a ton. And I think I also suppose that, if the objective is to just get a grade at the end that is B or better, one can probably put in little effort on it (probably even less than the reported 12 hours), and still get away with a good grade. However, if you are an avid learner who will try to acquire and absorb everything till the last ounce of knowledge offered, be prepared to put in some serious work, especially on the second half of the course. However, all in all, I would take it again for sure. I learned quite a bit about regression (logistic and linear), stochastic gradient descent. I have one criticism, which is the fact that very little attention is paid to regularization as it was very rushed through at the end of the semester and no practical activity really demanded it to be implemented (though the final exam has about 50% of all questions on it). These subjects can be seen as an intro to Machine Learning, and I believe it will help me quite a bit when I finally face Dart Vader (CS-7641 - Machine Learning). If you are also on the ML specialization tract, I seriously recommend you take DVA (before the other ML classes); just don't expect a walk in the park eating cake if your goal is to take good knowledge with you at the end.",

Second part was like an introduction to supervised machine learning, and it was not very deep in theory.\n\nThe schedule was a little bit tight, as there was a task due almost every week. Projects and assignments were not difficult but time consuming if you did not program in R before.\n\nGrading was generous. There were even five easy activities for us to get 5% extra credit.\n\nThis was my first course, so I cannot really  compare it with others. I think it is worth taking if you want to learn R and get exposed to the daily work of data analysts.",

                        "body": "*TLDR*: This is a graduate program, you are expected to work hard and work beyond what is provided to you. This course is an intro to ML/Data Science. Don't take it if you took ML already. \n\nThis was my first class at GT. I paired it along with KBAI. Although it's recommended to not take more than one class at a time, it wasn't my first time taking online classes, so I knew how to deal with the self-discipline of handling an online class. That being said:\n\nThe class wasn't difficult, but it was challenging. The first half of the course is a breeze (assuming you have programming experience and know basic statistics/visualizations). The second half of the course was more challenging, but it's where you learn. We implemented Logistic Regression from scratch, had to derive the cost function (partial derivative), and analyzed datasets, etc. The course serves more as an intro to Data Science as it covers visualizing data, cleaning data, modeling data, and deriving conclusions from data, overall making you think like a Data Scientist. I don't have a formal ML background (although I work in a Data Analytics team, so I'm exposed to it), so a lot of this material was not new for me. I do believe this is a good intro to ML/Data Science. \n\nOn another note, you will have to do independent studying to handle the 2nd half of the course. Prof Lebanon is quite dry and personally it was very difficult to pay attention to his lectures. Also, I didn't enjoy his teaching style. I made good use of Andrew Ng's ML course in order to understand some of the topics discussed in the second half.\n\nHaving completed only one of the extra credit tasks (called Activities), I ended up with an A. Professor Joyner taking over is probably the best thing that could've happened to this class. \n\nOne annoying part of this class however was how unprepared some students seemed to have been for a graduate program of this caliber (this is one of the easier courses of the program). Piazza was almost unbearable with the amount of simplistic questions that could have either been figured out independently or by a simple google search. I understand lots of people don't come from a CS/Software Engineering background, but the amount of hand holding some people needed/expected was almost ridiculous.",

The course teaches on how to visualize data, pre-process data (handle missing data), feature engineering and finally Linear and Logistic Regressions. Knowing some R libraries can really help speed up coding for the homeworks and projects. The visualization part of this course is also pretty good. They teach us about ggplots and other visualization techniques through activities (like graph networks and plotting data on world/country map) which are very powerful in creating visual charts with single line of code. I combined ML4T with this course and overall managed A in both. The 2 are a good combination. DVA exams are good , open book, open internet - second exam was special - very conceptual than memorizing.

For the rest of the class it was very easy, mostly just homework assignments where you had to shuffle data into different formats and then use libraries to display the data.\n\nOne frustrating aspect was that homework assignments were not graded in a timely manner. They often took 3-6 weeks to be graded. Part of the problem was that several TAs had accidents or unplanned events happen and so other semesters of this class may not experience such a long delay.\n\nI also wish that there had been more helpful feedback on assignments, usually they just marked the number of points you missed with a short comment to what section was wrong, but the comments were usually very cryptic.\n\nDr. Joyner was very kind when you approached him with grading questions and there were several times when an assignment would be awarded points because there were several students that missed a single question or because something wasn't very clear.\n\nOn average I spent 7 hours and 48 minutes per week, but there were some weeks where I did a lot more than others and the range is from 1:20 to 16:41 (that was one of the project 2 weeks).\n\nI would recommend studying calculus (which is does mention on the course info page) before homework 3, but other than that this was a pretty easy class.",

After taking the course, I have a much better understanding of regression and the basics of machine learning as well as a pretty solid foundation in R.\n\nI have an undergrad degree in CS from 10 years ago and haven't coded much since then, and I found it fairly straightforward to keep up. The homework assignments and projects were fairly time consuming for me because I didn't know R at all, but they were interesting and I learned a lot. Some weeks I spent 10-15 hours, other weeks I spent 0 because there was only a small extra credit assignment due. I found it fairly easy to get an A.\n\nI watched the lectures religiously early on, but later on I found the class discussions and google to be much more helpful. The TAs were helpful, but honestly I found the other students to be the most helpful. The professor was more of a manager of the TAs than a professor, but that's fine.\n\nI was intimated by the requirements of linear algebra and calculus since I am many years removed from college, but it didn't turn out to be that bad. One assignment requires you to do partial derivatives to come up with the equation you need to implement, but it wasn't too bad to fumble through with the help of Piazza. The other assignments did not require much deep math knowledge.",

For learning R, the course provides sufficient time to learn the language and I also heavily used the DataCamp \u201cData Analyst with R\u201d track and it made the homework\u2019s and projects a breeze. To tackle algebra and calculus, I referred to Khan Academy. Both these resources are more than sufficient to prepare for the course. \n\n The homework\u2019s, projects and activates are announced up front so that we can plan about them. Make sure you do all the activities since they are extra credits and help if one of the homework or project does not go well. The grading is lenient and it is not difficult to score an A.

Either you seem to hate it or love it. I personally hated it. It's my first OMSCS course, so I have little to compare it to. \n\n<b>Pros:</b>\n<ul><li>The class is extremely easy. The first quarter of the class is basically an introduction to R and an overview of the difference between scatter-plots and box-plots. If you can't pull an A, or at least a B, a master's program may not be right for you at this time. </li>\n<li>Dr. Joyner does seem to care about his students and this program. While he seemed overwhelmed at times, you could tell that he cared and wanted everyone to succeed. </li>\n</ul>\n<b>Cons: </b>\n<ul><li> The homework/assignments/exams are poorly written. This is especially true for both the midterm and final exam, which had quite a few questions that could have multiple answers depending on the interpretation of what was actually being asked. A few students started a mini Piazza \"revolt\" where they threatened to escalate issues with the class/midterm if their grievances weren't answered (ironically, they then learned that the person to escalate these issues to for OMSCS is Dr. Joyner).    </li>\n<li> There are a lot of helpful TAs, but they never seemed to be on the same page. There were multiple instances where I would get two very different answers to the same question from different TAs. For example, multiple TAs said on Piazza and Slack that homework had to be done in LaTeX to receive credit. However, when they posted \"exemplary homeworks\" one student had literally hand written his homework, taken pictures with his phone, and cut/pasted the images into a word document.</li>\n<li> The lectures are hilariously bad. It's like they were made in some dystopian future where everyone must speak in a monotone voice and ideas can only be expressed through Word 2010 clip art. More importantly, some of the required readings have massive errors. I was pretty disappointed that this course has been going on for multiple years, and this hasn't been fixed. I spent a bunch of time trying to figure out Dr. Lebanon's logistic regression proof, only to realize (about two hours in) that it's just wrong. </li></ul>\n\nOverall, if you want an easy A or want to learn R, take this class.",

This class was very active on Piazza and most of my general questions were asked and answered by other students. I did however have a specific code question and sent a private post to my assigned TA but received no response. \n\nThe first half of the course teaches the basics of R and how to model data. This was really helpful because I had no experience with R coming into this course. The second half of the course teaches a few machine learning techniques. I think this is a great course to take before you take the harder machine learning courses. \n\nThe homeworks in the first half of the course were very easy and fun because you get to play with R to create all kinds of visuals for the data. The homeworks in the second half took longer but I felt they were valuable lessons to learn machine learning if you haven't learned it already. There were 2 projects, both of which are not hard if you dedicate the time to do them. Project 1 took much longer than project 2, but project 2 builds off of project 1 and is easy if you did well on project 1 and were able to reuse some of the code. The exams were very easy if you watched the Udacity lectures and read the course readings. Exams are open book, notes, internet (the only thing not allowed is help from another person, chat boxes, etc). The instructor tried to stick very closely to the materials provided and gave us points back for materials on the exam that were not covered or phrased misleadingly. \n\nI think the grading was very lenient on all homeworks, projects, and exams. It would be hard not to receive an A in this class.",

Plus two open-book, open-internet exams. It was very manageable. To do well, one just needs to stick to this simple schedule.\n\nThe course is R-based, but it assumes no knowledge of R, spending the first couple of weeks teaching it. There is no need to learn it beforehand.\n\nThe first half of the course could be called \"Intro to working with data using R\", while the latter half could be called \"Intro to Machine Learning\". It's not clear to me why it spends so much time on machine learning topics, but it does, covering subjects such as linear regression, logistic regression, and regularization.\n\nInteracting with professor Joyner is a great pleasure - he's a fantastic teacher. On the other hand, the course seemed understaffed. I don't really mind the grading taking a little longer, but I think it's unfortunate that our inquiries about specific midterm questions were never fully addressed.\n\nOverall it's a solid course, especially for people new to the program.",

If you're a perfectionist and like finding out the \"right\" approaches to problems (eg, using the R vectorization instead of a for-loop, or tweaking your regression parameters to minimize RMSE as much as possible), the assignments can take a while. \n\nEach assignment was written in R, and you'll get a pretty decent grasp of the language. I would feel comfortable using it in a professional environment now.\n\nThere are five activities you can perform that each add 1 point of extra credit to your grade.\n\nThe TA's and students are very helpful on Piazza and Slack. I can't even count how many times I got stuck on a problem, only to find a relevant post somewhere on the community boards.\n\nDr. Joyner seems a lot about making a somewhat infamous class better and fairer to students. I don't agree at all with the below reviewer from my same semester who questions his ethics. It's clear that Joyner listened to student concerns and made fair adjustments. \n\n**Negatives**\n\nTo be honest, a few of the lectures were flat out boring to me. On the other hand, others were hilarious and bordered on the surreal - almost like I was watching a Tim and Eric episode. For example, Dr Lebanon has a penchant for using a cutout of his own head to illustrate topics, like when he mashed together angel and devil clip-art over his shoulder to represent Frequentists and Bayesians arguing... all the while talking about the topic in his droning monotone. Hilarious. I don't want to overstate it though - some of the lectures were great, and I'll likely watch some of them again.\n\nLots of the assignment instructions were pretty unclear, although I'm thankful to the TA's and other students for clearing most of them up. The midterm had some ambiguity in it too (not great for a multiple selection/multiple choice test), but to the instructors credit, they rectified the obvious ones and gave students' credit.",

Like the Fall 2017 semester, Professor Joyner once again joined the instructor team to help ensure things ran more or less smoothly. And by \"help\", I mean he appeared to be \"the\" instructor for the course (despite what the course sign-up states, Professor Chakraborty was not involved in anything student-facing). Dr. Joyner and the TAs did a nice job keeping us up-to-date and on-track, though it's a continued pet peeve of mine when an instructor literally ignores their students for the entire semester.\n\nContent-wise, the first half of the course's lectures were pretty good. Dr Lebanon's explanations and manner-of-speaking tend to make things needlessly complicated, especially when getting into the more math-heavy topics, but nothing was too overwhelming. The second half of the course was a lot harder to follow, again mainly due to the way the content was presented. Several students posted alternate sources of information on Piazza that made the concepts much easier to understand. It's like too much focus was placed on the theory and exact formulas rather than what it actually means in practice.\n\nThe projects and homeworks were all pretty fair, in my opinion, even though I came in with no R experience whatsoever. Some assignments were intimidating to start, but became more manageable after spending some time playing with them. The TAs also posted helpful hints for some assignments. The exams were both a bit crude, handled via ProctorTrack. The midterm had a lot of disagreement with wording and ambiguity. The instructor team did eventually address a few of the questions about a month later and gave some points back, but other questions were never clarified.\n\nGrade-wise, it still seems fairly easy to get an A as long as you're not waiting until the last minute to do an assignment (and almost everything is available from the first week of class, so there's no need to wait). Four homeworks worth 10% each, two projects worth 20% each, two exams worth 10% each, and 5 activities worth 1% each. Since that's 105%, you've got 15% of leeway to stay in \"A\" range. There didn't seem to be many issues with grading as long as you followed the requirements.\n\nCommunication-wise is where things could have been better. The TAs were great for office hours on Slack and generally responsive on Piazza, but private posts would get ignored and it seemed like there were some topics the TAs didn't want to get involved with.\n\nAll-in-all, a pretty good class if you're interested in R, but the lectures were often awkward to watch and the algebra portions didn't really add much to the course in any meaningful way."

Lectures had a few interesting bits, but mostly took a long time to say something pretty straightforward.  Homeworks/projects were tedious and had to be written in R.  Graders deducted points for random things which weren't even in the instructions.  Both of the exams were poorly-written and somewhat ambiguous.  (There were disputes on a significant number of the questions.)  On the plus side, the homeworks and projects were released ahead of time, so at least you could work ahead if your scheduled allowed.",

I believe this may be the most time-intensive course in the OMSA program, and I recommend either taking it early or as a \"capstone\" class to finish up the program.\n\nThe most challenging part of this course was the amount of time that needed to be put into the assignments and projects. The concepts were arguably quite simple, each assignment required learning one or more new programming languages and/or technologies. Setup of the environments required often took a lot of time too. Dr. Chau was receptive to feedback, and modified the last assignment to have one of the questions be for bonus credit, which helped it be more manageable. It's possible the online course will change dramatically based on the course feedback. That said, it is an incredibly time intensive course and you should plan accordingly.\n\nThe project was... frustrating (to me). The assignments were so time intensive that our team struggled to work on the project early on and ended up pulling things together at the last minute. Another challenge was the difficulty in making group decisions when a group leader wasn't established and the whole team couldn't find time to meet virtually.\n\nI will address the concern about using Azure and AWS with a personal credit card as stated in another review. While, yes, it was annoying and uncomfortable to provide that information, for both services we got much, much more free credit than was needed to complete the assignment, and students who did go over the free limit were able to get the charges waived by calling customer support and explaining the situation. The Azure part of the assignment could be completed on a personal computer and then uploaded to the server, eliminating any chance of error/using up the credit.\n\nI learned so much in this class and was exposed to a large number of data technologies. I know there are some people who struggled greatly with this class, but I found it comparable to (if not easier than) my undergrad engineering courses at a top-ranked engineering school, so the quality was what I expected. I think the class does have room for improvement, and could use more TA support to improve communication and responses to Piazza. All said, I wish I had used this as a capstone class toward the end of my degree and had taken it on its own, so I could have gotten more out of the project.",

I also learned more in this class than any other class - a direct output of the fact that I spent more time on this class than ever before.\n\nDr. Chau is extremely reasonable and truly cares about his students. It is easy to get an A in this class as long as you spend the time. Generally you will be able to keep working/debugging code until you are certain that it is 100% correct. You have 3 weeks per HW assignment, which is reasonable as long as you start working immediately and don't procrastinate on the group project.\n\nMy only gripe about this class is that it should be worth 6 credit hours instead of 3. There is no way that the amount of content covered and work required for this class should be weighted the same as courses like ISYE 6501 and MGT 6754 which generally are in the 5-7 hours/week range.",

Though I expected the work to be difficult (my courses last semester in the OMSA program certainly were), it has bordered on impossible at several points given the unreasonably complicated nature of the work we are assigned.  I spent more time decoding confusing instructions and being my own IT support this semester than I did working on any visualization projects or concepts. I was very close to withdrawing from the class and if it weren\u2019t for the group project and the fear of letting my teammates down, I probably would have dropped it.\n\nFor each homework set I spent at least the first week (40+ hours) just trying to get my computer set-up with the software/environments necessary to even start programming. In several instances this has required making changes to the firmware, multiple uninstalls and re-installs all of which are incredibly time-consuming and I think not the point of this course. My only computer is my work computer and I have felt quite nervous about how these changes I have made might impact my machine and my ability to do my job if it were to crash. \n\nTo complete a homework assignment students were required to join Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure, both of which required entering personal credit card information. For each of these services there was the potential of running up thousands of dollars in charges if a mistake was made. This is an entirely unacceptable risk to ask students to take. Often learning takes place when mistakes are made and to put a financial burden on students who are already paying to learn is wrong.\n\n\nAt several points throughout the semester direct messages to the instructors went unanswered for days. At one point a very urgent message (labeled as such in the subject line) was ignored for 84 hours. At the point it was answered it was too late.\n\nThe difficulty I have had this semester has caused me to question my future in this program. If the 40+ hours per week of work needed for this course is indicative of any future courses, continuing to pursue this degree will be incompatible with maintaining my full-time job and family responsibilities.  I understand that Tech\u2019s rigor is a part of its great reputation, and fully expected my classes to be very challenging. However, I did not expect to be subjected to unreasonable expectations and poor communication by professors in a professional graduate curriculum like the \u201cweed-out\u201d courses I had during undergrad.",

You could easily work ahead if you wished though reading the piazza discussions about the material often helped if you waited till later. As with most grad school classes, you get out of it what you put into it. If you want to spend a lot of time and really get things perfect you can. If you want to spend a lot less time and do the minimum you can still do pretty well you just won't learn as much. If you want a good way to learn R this is a good way to do that and learn some visualization things as well. Liked the projects a lot. The exams were a little tricky, but the instructor was willing to go back and look at them (at least on the midterm). Have not yet attempted the final.",

I can say it is one of the best online courses I ever did. The instructor is very passionate and very knowledgeable and the assignments are challenging but you end up learning a lot.\n\nYou will learn a lot about D3, and some bits about modeling and Big data technologies, but you will get a good general picture of what a full data pipeline project looks like.\n\nThe presentations are very enjoyable and well crafted, and you will make some friends thanks to a group project that will require at least 4-5 meetings. \n\nAll this said, this course could be improved on some aspects, one of which is time management and a bit more of hand holding. So don't underestimate the amount of time you will need for it. There are 4 BIG homeworks, so don't procrastinate and work steadily, if you do that I estimate around 20hours per week."

I did 2 semesters of Calculus over 25 years ago (as well as a semester of linear algebra).\nThe homeworks and projects were generally OK. Homework 3 required you to code logistic regression by hand, when there are perfectly good functions built in, so that was pretty absurd. Especially since the lectures were very high level. It was basically the old game where they teach you how to draw an owl by drawing 2 ovals and then in the next frame show you a finished detailed owl. Good luck with that one.\nThis was my first class. If my next semester is the same experience, I will be dropping out.

This course provided a refresh on calculus and linear algebra which I guess is useful when I get deeper in ML. I also took this course to learn R as a new language, which I think the course material did a good job on that, but maybe too much as it seems like it assumes minimum background in coding. So if you, like me, are a professional developer for years, you may find it boring.\n\nThe workload is light, only exception is the first project which you need to do some partial derivatives and implement a logistic regression model using R from scratch. The requirement wasn't clear until couple of days before the deadline, which makes it hard if you want to finish it early on you own pace. But since most of the HW and projects are due early Monday mornings, you have good chance to spend your weekend and should be able to get it done.

A few students expressed concerns about grading consistency with the first two homework assignments, but regrades are underway. The current construction has one homework that is machine learning heavy and that has been the source of the most complaints on Piazza. As with ML4T the topics are introduced in lecture, but possibly not in sufficient depth for someone without recent undergraduate background in CS theory and math (partial derivatives of vectors). Both ML4T and DVA include machine learning topics along with domain topics (pandas, stocks and R, visualization respectively). BTW, there is currently no mid-term, only homeworks, projects and a final. Overall, I'm glad I took DVA this semester.

It was an easy A for me but I would rather have had the class be more challenging and actually learned more--I don't feel like I learned much beyond some very basic Machine Learning concepts. \n\nThe professor and most of the TAs were mostly absent from Piazza and it was like pulling teeth to get any sort of response from them. The instructions for the homework weren't clear and it was difficult to get anything clarified. The TAs would tell us something and then the homework would be graded the opposite of what they had told us. TAs and professor would contradict each other all the time. At the time of the final exam, I had only gotten back my grades for HW1 and HW2 (out of 3 homeworks, 2 projects, and some additional extra credit activities). This was frustrating since some of the questions on the final were related to things we did in the homework and projects, and when I wasn't sure if I had done those things correctly I thus wasn't sure how to answer the questions on the final correctly. \n\nI got high scores on the homework and projects but I have to wonder if it's just because there was such a backlog of grading to do close to the end of the semester that the TAs just rushed through it and gave almost everyone As. I'm guessing at least half of the class ended up with an A, especially due to the extra credit--it may have actually been closer to 75%. \n\nI was hoping to learn a lot about data visualization but it was mostly just a tutorial in how to use ggplot2 and a short discussion of the different types of plots one can create. The lectures were very shallow and general--I wish there had been more of them. It was probably only about 6 hours of lectures total for the entire class. It just felt like it wasn't enough, and it also felt like the professor (who was NOT the same professor as the one in the lectures) didn't really care about this class at all. \n\nDISAPPOINTED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",

I was excited about learning R and for the potential opportunities I would have to apply what I learned at my workplace.

It feels like a chore to me now because of how much I really disliked doing work for this class. I'll never forget the moment when the first grade was returned in this class. The Piazza statistics for the class showed that there were 6x the number of posts of a typical day when it was released. People didn't understand what they did wrong. And it took over a week for the instructors to generate any kind of reasoning for the grading. One would think that a rubric should be available to handle discrepancies... but it didn't appear that way. For the rest of the assignments, I felt like I had to perform 150% just to get a good grade on an assignment. For the second project, my report was 40 pages long. I did get an A but I honestly wasn't confident that I had done enough. \n\nThe professor did admit at the end of the semester concerns had been heard and improvements could be made. So hopefully they will be!\n\nOn top of the disorganization, this was also a hard course in general. Here are some things to review if you decide to tackle this course:\n* Machine Learning\n* R (the language)\n* Statistics\n* Calculus \n* Vectorization (specifically in R)\n* Big O",

If you don't you are going to be in hell that term. \n* Final exams had questions and concepts that weren't taught in the course. \n* I don't think I would have gotten an A without taking few external ML courses which added a huge burden to the time consuming projects that are there in this course. \n* Oh and if you by mistake looked at the course offered on-campus, that is no where related to this online course.

It was useful to learn the guts of the mathematics behind some of the core algorithms (e. g., gradient descent). Some students complained/struggled about having to use high school/early college Calculus but it should be reasonable/expected in a graduate program like this one and in particular the field of ML and Data Science.

In the previous semester, Dr. Lebanon was very involved and helped students understand the assignment intent. This semester, Dr. Chakraborty was MIA most of the semester. The grading was inconsistent, the TAs were frequently combative, and the instructor's solutions to problems were frequently terrible. \n\nOur final exam appears to have been written at the last minute. Out of 35 questions, 3 were on material not covered in the course, 3 had issues that caused the instructor to admit they were bad, and 2 had multiple correct answers. To make up for these questions, the instructor added 3 points to everyone's score and then refused to take any grade challenges. This solution is unfair and took many students from an A to a B gradewise. I was fortunate to not be one of them, but this class is the worst run class I have experienced out of 9 OMS classes - I am sorry I took it!\n\nThe on-campus course this spring looks like an amazing course, dealing with lots of big data technologies. Instead, we got a basic introduction to R, which I hope to never see again - it's that poor a language choice. This class really should be taught in Python and should cover more relevant topics like the on campus course.

The course contents were actually pretty good though quite light. The assignments and projects were also OK. However, the final exam and the overall grading was terrible. There were a dozen TAs, but no grading criteria or rubrics, while all assignments and final exams were essay like reports... This created a total disaster. Maybe because the grading load was too much, TAs did not seem to spend much time on (or even care about) our tens of pages of reports, and the grading was generous but quite random, with no meaningful feedback given. In fall 2016 they put some example assignments on piazza and after the exam, some students voluntarily shared their exams, but similar answers were given very different scores. One of the answers that got full score was almost identical as mine, but mine got 3/11. After I pointed out that my answer was similar to others but got significant lower score, the professor simply said that happens, but since mine was not perfect, the original grading was valid. So in the end I stuck at 79. 7 with a C... \nAdditionally, after the final exam, many students found out that they were not able to see a big chunk of the final exam-a third of the exam didn't show up on proctor track... I still don't know how they dealt with these angry students. \nI filed the grading grievance and started to take the same class again, because I needed it to graduate. As of now, I haven't heard anything from the grievance, and the semester is already ended. \nSpring 2017 is even worse, the instructor disappeared for the most part of the semester, and we only got 20% grading done two weeks before the final. There were several angry posts on Piazza, and some students filed grievances. \nFor this semester, I simply resubmitted most of my assignments with a little editing. And I got higher than 100. Ridiculous.",

I ever sent out a private message to my TA, and he responded, after tow-three weeks. \n3) The grading is very slow. Some of the projects are connected. You don't know whether your solution for the previous project is correct, while the second one is already due. \n4) I'm not sure whether the instructor and TAs communicate, because sometimes their responses to student questions contradict to each other. \n\nIn terms of grading, the instructor is lenient. He find every opportunity to give out extra credits. I learned little from this course. All I did is collecting points. \n\nAs a conclusion, if you want to get a high score, go for it; if you want to learn something from the course, avoid it before the instructor is ready."

I have little or no complaints as far as that goes. Several of the TAs did seem to go above and beyond the call of duty to try to salvage the class. You will read a ton about the R language. If you have experience with python Pandas library, then it should be (somewhat) familiar. \n\nMy advice to potential students is to wait until they fix the class to take it unless you need it immediately to fulfill the ML specialization. My advice to GT is to cast this class back into the abyss. \n\nEDIT: Also, the extremely positive review below is bullshit. The complaints about this class are legitimate. Many of the people \"complaining\" (including myself) have successfully completed many OMSCS courses without the kinds of issues experienced in this class."

As somebody who has served both as a professor at top research institutions and worked at respected companies in industry, he is qualified to design such a class. \n\nI took the class in Fall and I see there are negative reviews from Spring. Not exactly sure what happened, because the lecture materials are the exact same and I understand the assignments were almost the exact same. Sounds like assignments not being returned in a timely fashion is a valid concern, but I imagine should be fixed with future iterations of the class. But some of the complaints about the material and the ambiguity of grading seem unwarranted, I don\u2019t necessarily expect a class to have to explicitly lay out grading criteria ahead of time and they weren\u2019t in the Spring and students did not complain. I am puzzled why reviews are THAT different between semesters.

I think that the first half of the course is generally useful and not overly challenging. They do provide pointers to an entire book on visualization using the ggplot2 package, which if you read from cover to cover and play around with it could satisfy those who already have exposure to R and ggplot2. The second half of the course will probably be challenging if it is your first exposure to linear and logistic regression, and it will probably not be overly difficult if you have studied those topics before. I did not have that exposure before this class, and the rest of my review assumes that. \n\nAs for pacing, the class is relatively slow in the beginning. You are probably looking at more like 6-8 hours per week on average of required work. If you dive into additional references and optional assignments, you can spend more (and get a deeper understanding). The pace really picks up from the first project onward. As students in past semesters have noted, the projects will take up as much time as you have, and you will always feel like you could have done more. On average, you are probably looking at more like 12-15 hours per week at that point, and it may be bursty. \n\nNow, as for the class logistics... I think most of the reviews for the semester have been at an overly negative extreme, and the one just below seems a bit too positive (hello fellow undergrad alum!). There were problems. They were not handled in the best manner. Piazza became out-of-control negative. Communication from the professor was often sparse. CIOS feedback should be given to avoid this in the future. I am proceeding under the assumption the professor will take CIOS feedback to heart. But if he doesn't, I would avoid his classes in the future.",

Although I did wish we spent less time on R and include another project. \nThe homework and projects were fair with more than enough time, but once again people waited until the last minute to ask questions and panicked when they didn't receive a step-by-step solution to solving the problem... pathetic. \n\nThe only complaint I will make is that grading took way too long. However, if you really need feedback you can just ask the TA if your code is correct. Regardless, you should know if your code is working based on the questions, so the feedback is not useful except for stating why you lost a few points (maybe for not including enough graphs). \n\nDon't let other reviews scare you. \nI know I sound like a drop in the ocean, but being a GT alumni I know the difference between a good and bad course. \nThis is definitely the former.",

Regardless, the lack of timely feedback and consistency of assignment clarification led to a lot of unnecessary confusion. I'm all for an appropriate level of confusion regarding course content, as that's called \"learning, \" but this semester was a logistical mess. Props to Adrian Chang, our TA who went above and beyond in grading, Piazza responsiveness, and overall engagement. Tough to do for 500 students, especially when the prof was frequently absent or seemingly unreachable. \n\nRegarding curriculum only (in hopes of logistical improvement for future course iterations): I don't come from a math background, and could have brushed up on calculus before enrolling. I thought this course would be more focused on visualization principles. There was some ggplot experimentation with project 1, but it's mostly about using basic ML models and R to analyze data. Glad to get a first taste of logistic & linear regression, but am pretty convinced I don't want to use R or ggplot ever again.",

Too much of ambiguity, too much of (needless) load, makes learning second priority., e. g. Use of loops, run it 5 times, 10 times, 500 times, sorta questions, asking Complexity, No doubt this is essentials, but DVA is not meant for that. \nAnd cryptic messages for communication, asking TA's Or Prof. question over piazza or slack, u get very terse/generic feedback. I just couldn't realize Did TA/Prof. wanted to remove ambiguity or add to it. Like any stupid student I dared sometime, to re-ask the next question, to get No further reply. \nSome of my Piazza posts remained, unanswered. If I pass this course, it would be because of my own work and students who were active and prompt on piazza. \nNewly hired Prof. n TA's, Couldn't make this course interesting, neither they could make us realize potential of the course. Project/Assignment grading took forever, Course is about to finish, and we're yet \nto get feedback for half of our work. \nWith all due respect, I really doubt their credentials, to carry on, GT plz review this staff. \nDespite student asking for ideal answers, we never got any positive feedback on it. Grading is generous at times, but, rather than that, I'd prefer, what went wrong and how can I improve it. \nOhh, and how can we forget, TA Jiachen Yang's epic sarcasm. I think This guy, should be given privilege to write, pre-requisite section of DVA/and every other subject in OMSCS for next semesters. \nFall2017/Summer2017 ** Won't recommend this course, until GT reviews this **",

If you are registered or waitlisted for this course PLEASE read the Spring 2017 reviews! \n\nThis class has been the worst I've taken in this program. I've rated this class as Easy because the contents are basic and the assignments are not complicated. This course should be seen as \"Learn R by example\". However, having a large class created dozens of different interpretations to the homework instructions that eventually led to great degrees of confusion. I have a perfect score in all returned grades so far and it has been because I've stayed away from Piazza and office hours. I just read and re-read the assignment instructions always thinking what else I would want to see if I was grading this assignment. I know that some will say it is not the student's role but the methodology of going above and beyond has worked well in this program. \n\nOne of the main issues this class had was amount of contradicting information given many times. In several occasions it was mentioned to us that the TAs had a hard time reaching the professor when asked to clarify. \n\nThe staff in this class needs to be evaluated. It was evident the TAs don't talk to each other and a few do not know how to handle students' queries. One in particular tried to seem tough in front of the class justifying their answers by telling everyone that this is GT (I agree with this argument). However the tone and level of sarcasm used in (their) posts came out as confrontational. You are an instructor and if you are part of the team that answers the forums you need to work on your communicational skills! If you are frustrated, take a break and answer a post in a couple of hours or take a walk before answering!\n\nAs a side note, there is a review here that claims the professor was blaming the TAs for \"dropping the ball\", That is not true, it was a TA that said that. \n\nTL;DR: Wait for this class to be reviewed by GT!",

This is sixth OMSCS course and by far one of the worst three courses I have ever taken in my entire life. I would quite the program if this were my first course. The content is very simple, some quirky R language, logistic/linear regression, and regularization for feature selection. The near nonexistence of course organization and lack of pedagogy make the course very difficult. Basically, the professor plays the video recorded by another professor and TAs do the grading without interacting to students. I requested clarification on Piazza via a private post. A TA replied after 14 days and with 3 reminders. The professor lacks basic pedagogic skills. There are a lot of ambiguities in the project spec, e. g., phrases \"describe as precise as possible\" are used in the project spec for HW2 instead of explicitly listing all items are required. Another example is that he asks the students to describe patterns in a plot and later we are penalized for not explaining the plausible reasons for the patterns according to the grading rubric. It is funny that the grading rubric is released two or three weeks after the homework were submitted. The project spec is so ambiguous that there are literally hundreds of posts asking for clarifications and contradictory information are posted by TAs and the professor. There is one TA responded students post with sarcasm and in confrontational tone. I believe this course is bad enough to raise attention from the school. Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course on Coursera is better alternative for basics. \n\nUpdate:\nConstant delay on releasing grade and even the final exam was released a few hours late.

He clearly does not take teaching nor this job seriously, nor concern about the success of the students. \nI have taken 4 classes, loved them all, but not this one. Arpana and few TAs (BTW, apparently we are all unworthy to TA Jiachen Yang) are clearly inexperienced and ill prepared. Awful communication skills, no rubric in assignments, students repeatedly complain having to read the TAs' minds but the staff so far provided no resolution regarding the issue. There are extra credit assignments that are worth 1 point each in final grade, but it's all 1 point or nothing, providing little or no incentive to complete the extra credits since they are poorly defined. TAs are poorly coordinate among themselves and routinely release contradicting information, which snowball into a sea of Piazza threads. No peer feedback, no exemplary work. Project 1 was due Mar 6, 2017, still haven't been graded as of April 4, 2017 due to some TAs dropped the ball. Not looking forward to the final exam which account for 30% of the grade. One big reason I join OMSCS was to avoid this kind of teaching. GaTech needs to evaluate the staff carefully to uphold and preserve the integrity of this program. I suggest the staff take the playbook from other courses like ML4T or CP or KBAI for future version of this course.",

One more project and final exam is remaining. The course starts out easy, first homework is very easy [introduction to R concepts and programming], second homework is moderate [introduction to ggplot2 and data visualization techniques]. The first project was analyzing movies dataset. There were ten questions with lot of subdivisions and each was equivalent to one homework. The third homework is implementing logistic regression algorithm from scratch and optimizing the code so that it runs fast thus enabling to train and test on the dataset given. I am new to ML domain, and the lecture covered in the video was not at all enough to complete the homework, I had to watch the relevant portions in Andrew NG's course to gain the intuition behind logistic regression. It was hard work but at the end, I felt good implementing the algorithm and training it. \nThis course starts off as easy and by the time you realize that the course is taking all the free time you have, it is well past the drop deadline. I would strongly advise students with no experience in ML domain to take this course as a single course. If you want to double up, it can be paired only with courses which are front loaded like the AI4R course. I have put 18 hours per week but that is applicable only to the second half of the course.",

TAs are very lazy and don't answer the questions or answered in a very misleading way. Then at grading stage, they will surprise you and interpret the question in a different way it is being asked, and deduct points from the students. A few classic examples: 1. what is the growth rate of different format of file size? (They graded with big(O) notation) 2. Describe your observation (grading notes released after three weeks of submission saying, you can't say A is bigger than B, you have to say A is 4% and B is 3%, so A is bigger than B). The answer is in the figure the students submit, but the reason most of us didn't put them in the final conclusion is the assignment didn't ask it in the beginning. \nDefinitely the worst course have been seen in OMSCS",

It felt very rough - there's little lecture and many assignments required considerable time searching the web to figure out things you needed that weren't in the class material. Students found the assignments ambiguous, and piazza questions were answered very slowly and not in a clear manner. The original professor, Dr. Lebanon, was swapped out for Dr. Chakraborty and I just felt he wasn't really prepared for the class. Assignment time started very short, but then ramped up to be very large. I found the 10 questions on project 1 were taking 9-10 hours each, which got to be a real problem. It felt like the instructors had not done the assignments themselves and didn't have a good understanding of their sizing, plus ambiguity and uncertainty in grading (only 1 HW was returned by week 8) made you tend to overdo everything. It's unfortunate because I like the topic and Dr. Chakraborty did take steps to restructure assignments, but the overall theme was \"too little, too late\". Also the syllabus is strange - the second half is all basic machine learning, and didn't feel like it belonged, while there was no treatment of visual esthetics - what makes a visualization look good vs. bad, how to style it best, etc. I would wait until this class is much more mature.",

                        "body": "(To be updated hopefully once the term ends)\nThe class this semester started on the wrong foot, and the general experience had been sour since then. It is a shame because the instructor is really keen on making the experience very educational and fun. He has prepared non-required activities where you can probably learn more without the pressure of trying to get a good grade. \n\nWhat I think went wrong this thus far:\n- Unpopular decisions made by the instructor team. Personally I do not mind that much, but it is very reasonable for most people not to like it. And with a class size so big, those small \"mistakes\" have bad effects in high order of magnitude. \n- It seems the grading rubrics are not tightly coupled to the learning goals of the homeworks (or at least what I thought to be the goals are). The most popular \"mistake\" was giving huge deductions for missing complexity analysis in an HW where the goal is to get acquainted with R. Or deductions for not giving actual numbers when calculating those values are just incidental to the HW and the main goal was to visualize those numbers (this one is very minor). \n\nI really hope things turn for the better soon. \n\nThe topics in the course were by the way not what I thought they were. I was thinking more on statistics: hypothesis testing, trend analysis (I think this one will be covered), knowing whether the samples are sufficient, blah blah. Stuff I would need if I want to do research and decide to do surveys, A/B tests, whatever. The syllabus was so short I thought there are a lot more in betweens. Not really, that is it. In the HWs, we were usually asked to give an analysis of results. But I don't really know how to give those analysis correctly, so I end up giving very vague analyses (weakly related, higher, lower). I am yet to see my grade for HW2. The Instructor Team has an aversion for vagueness, so I am not very excited about my grade.",

If you already know something about ML, then this class will be easy, if not, you are going to constantly look for more references, as the epic Machine Learning course by Andrew Ng, or the Data Science specialization on Coursera. \nThe final exam was a disaster, we got partial details of it until days before to take it. They told us that there were only 3 questions, but actually each question had 3 equally complex subquestions. There were topics on it that we didn't see during the course and weren't listed on the prerequisites, how were we suppose to answer those questions? we'll never now because we never received feedback of the final. Apparently for some students, this is ok as it's been like that on other classes, but come on! it is not ok! we need feedback to learn and do better, if not it is a waste of time.",

The biggest concern I had, but I accepted during the first, registration, week of class was the homework/project/final grades were all equally weighted at 1/3 of the grade. This was a concern and a bit of stress toward the end of the semester, but I was a consenting adult/student like everyone else in the class, so I didn't think it was unfair. I would say the course was neither unbearable nor easy. I earned an A and think those who participated did reasonably well.",

They were both really fun, but can be super time consuming depending on the quality of the report you feel comfortable submitting. I probably went overboard on mine, but mostly because I was enjoying myself. Full marks on the project are likely achievable with about 10-15 hours worth of effort (and we were given 4 weeks). I felt the final was very fair and interesting. Several students had issues with it, but those appeared to be more related to how proctor-track displayed (or hid) the exam questions, rather than with the content itself. The grading tended to be lenient this semester, but that may change with the new instructor. I'm sorry to hear Dr. Lebanon wont be teaching next time. He did a fantastic job.

My honest assessment of my performance was that I probably earned in the 65-75 range, but I was shocked to see that I scored in the 90s. It was very open-ended and I made sure to answer every part of every question, but I do feel like I missed the bar on some of the questions in which I received perfect marks. \n\nThese are good problems to have, I guess (rather than the other way around). \n\nOverall, nice class, and it's unfortunate that Prof. Lebanon (who produced the very nice lectures) will not be continuing as the instructor of record. Given that, it remains to be seen how generously this course will be graded in the future.",

Part 2 takes longer if you really try to apply everything including things that may not have been covered yet. Make sure you just plan accordingly and don't wait until the last moment for things. That is the only time you will really run into trouble. \n\nOverall, I thought this would give more industry experience given that Prof Lebanon has worked at a variety of large companies. I think I learned more from other students who were nice enough to post explanation than I did from the professor. I would also recommend getting The Elements of Statistical Learning as an alternate reference for this course since there is little reference material provided.

I myself had no prior experience and really wanted to apply myself so that I can properly internalize the core concepts and found myself working around 20 hours a week. However someone with experience in ML and ML4T can get by with no more than 10 hours a week of effort. \n- Math is a tough thing to get up to speed on but we have had some really engaging piazza discussions that solidified my understanding and the students really take it upon themselves to make sure their fellow classmates are in a position to succeed. It's great. \n- Instructor is very responsive and I have yet to see a relevant question unanswered by him. Hes got some great experience in ML and does a good job of breaking down the concepts into digestible chunks. \n\nFinal takeaway is to definitely take this class if you are in the ML track but if you are already quite proficient in ML and R, this class may not give you anything more.",

Fortunately this part of the homework is the only homework / project that you actively need a math skillset; fortunately the instructor is very lenient on discussing the math section, to the point where a legendary student (who is also a math professor) walked the class through most of the problem and there was no complaint from the instructor.

Coming from a SAS-heavy background with no knowledge of R, I've appreciated the opportunity to get my hands into data manipulation and visualization using R. We also had the opportunity to learn the mechanics behind linear regression, logistic regression, and regularization. \n\nThere are 4 homeworks (technically 3, but the 3rd counts as double and is twice as long), all of which have been doable in a reasonable amount of time. The project this semester is divided into two parts, and is about analyzing and visualizing movie characteristics from IMDB's database to find the best predictors for gross revenue. I thought it was pretty neat to be given a real world problem with imperfect data to analyze. Don't procrastinate on the project. Unless you're really handy with R, it'll probably take 30-50 hours for each part (divided into two parts, due at different times). \n\nI really enjoy watching the lectures (sped up to 1. 5x), and the professor provides the lecture slides so you can actually just sit, comprehend, and follow the notes rather than screenshotting the video every two minutes. The professor is very active on Piazza, which makes up for the extreme lack of TA participation.",
