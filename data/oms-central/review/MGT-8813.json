The information she conveys is multiple hours of content which leaves you confused, searching through the video frame by frame to see what her excel formula was. I spend more time ignoring her words and just trying to copy and paste the correct cells.\n\nThis class could be 1/4 or less the time which it is now whilst conveying much more information in an efficient way. For example, her homework instructions accompanying the homeworks randomly jump around and multiple times add things like \"DO NOT TYPE IT IN THIS BOX, INSTEAD SAVE IT FOR THAT BOX WHEN YOU ARE READY TO START YOUR OTHER SHEET\". A simple usage of bullet points would avoid the need for color-coded messy instructions.\n\nThis class could be so much less painful if we were just given an excel file example and taught the philosophy of the course. Instead, we need to pour over the videos and just hear her yap on and on in a disorganized fashion (often shooting off into other, quasi-relevant points) about a topic I really went from finding interesting to hating.\n\nA missed opportunity and a LOT of busy work.",

Some may dislike Garner's approach to handholding of going through step by step in every Excel cell but I don't think this was the point of it.\n\nLearning how to read and understand financial statements requires a different modality of thinking to learning a programming language, library, or framework. As such, it requires a different approach to learning the content and I think Garner did an amazing work with this.\n\nThe material itself is dry, but it has nothing to do with the quality of the class but rather the subject matter in itself. Having this understanding will be helpful in the long run of your career.",

There is totally no critical thinking needed in this class. Just follow the steps and you get your A.

It's an easy A whether you decide to try and learn the material or not, I think there are some useful things in here like learning to read balance sheets and Statement of Cashflows etc. but the easy format of the class means you'll only retain the info if you really are interested it, which i wasnt",

                        "body": "I don't mind an easy class, and I surely am not insisting on taking only classes that take 20+ hours/week, so my complaint about this class not that it is \"easy\" like most reviews imply this is the problem. My problem with this class is that it forces you to watch lectures and follow them blindly on excel, and if you even dare to think and do things slightly differently, even if you end up with the same answer, then you will be penalized. Any class in this program, even DVA or CDA or BDFHC will seem \"easy\" if you are given a tutorial video and all you have to do is to follow it blindly, and although this makes it easier not only for the students, but also for the instructor and the TAs, still this will usually results in students learning nothing. \n\nThe slack channel for this class is dead, and the few posts on Piazza are  mostly asking for how to name their files, and there is barely any useful discussion, and I guess it is because everything is spoon-fed to the extent that you loose the desire to learn. Yes, the instructor and the TAs are professional and responsive, but why wouldn't they when it seems that they are required to do the least effort compared to any other class in the program. \n\nSo how to improve this class? Give assignments that require the students to think and learn. It will require more effort from the TAs because students will then be asking questions and the assignments will not be auto-evaluated anymore, but at least then the students will graduate from the class learning something!!!!",

Also, many of examples provided were very manual compared to more efficient methods.  For example, depreciation values were looked up using a nested IF statement with cell by cell reference rather than a simple vlookup.  Because of the macro grading, using a more advanced formula was discouraged.   Marcro grading also required following steps exactly even if you could achieve the right end result.\n\nThe professor is very knowledgeable and helpful.

It will probably take 5 hours per week in a regular (Fall/Spring) semester. Some weeks took more, and a few weeks took less.\nMost of the time I spent watching the lecture videos and following along with a spreadsheet. At first I thought that might be boring, but I did learn a few things with optimization and VBA. Also learned some techniques to use Excel to perform some matrix math. I found many times, I could watch the videos at 1.5x speed. But then sometimes I'd go back and rewatch sections.  \n\nI think I understand the financial formulas better after taking Financial Modeling, than when I took the Business Fundamentals course - where they give a bunch of terms and formulas to memorize. In addition to financial formulas, I have a better understanding of some of the math concepts behind them. Maybe it's just me, but how Covariance works and what it can be used for makes more sense after this course.\n\nDr. Garner was active in Piazza and on every Office Hour that I attended (I attended most of them). The TA's were responsive as well. Office hours were not a required attendance, but I attended many because I enjoyed them. \n\nI'm not sure if this is true of the other Business electives, but this class had less than 100 students, so the forums and office hours felt more personal. Another plus to FM - there are no exams. There are 4 or 5 individual homework assignments and 4 group case studies (analyzing a company using different methods). \n\nI liked the way groups are done in this class. We were allowed to reach out to form our own groups during the first week or so, then anybody who couldn't find groups were assigned. She encourages us to come to agreement as a group to find a workload balance. She has a nice spreadsheet which each group member submits to help keep grading proportional to each member's effort.\n\nIf you are looking for a Business Track elective, then I would recommend Financial Modeling. You may even think about taking this before the Business Fundamentals course, as some of the concepts are explained in easier to understand format - at least for me.",

It's a bit of a GPA pad like most of the MGT courses in OMSA, but there's still good information to learn from the class. \n\nI'd recommend it for someone in the Business track who wants to learn more about Financial models and Excel. If you're looking for hard-core \"analytics modeling\", this isn't the class for you. \n\nThe good:\n- Upping your Excel skills in a significant way even if you're well versed in Excel\n- Learning to analyze company financial statements\n- Understanding different methods of company valuation\n\nWhat's to improve:\n- The content is a bit spoon fed. The professor basically shows you 100% of what to do to make the calculations. I think she could have left more for you to discover and figure out on your own.\n- Some of the lectures are quite long and tedious (see above)\n- The class is good at teaching you the mechanics of the various Excel models, but doesn't focus as much on the WHY.

It's more like MGT 8803's finance portion, except an entire semester's worth. Reviewing various financial statements and doing very simple math.\n\nThe only software we use is Excel. I learned a few new tricks there (like did you know you can do Matrix multiplication?? I didn't!) but generally didn't gain the type of knowledge I wouldn't have wanted. Not to say it had no use at all - I learned how to build a loan amortization table and figure out what would happen to my mortgage under various scenarios, as well as the aforementioned Excel skills.\n\nThere are a few individual homeworks, most of which can be completed by watching the lectures and copying what the instructor puts in the cell, letter-by-letter. There are also four group projects, which are like the homeworks but more involved. They're still fairly simple, you could probably do all four by yourself, but they're group projects. You also grade your group-mates' effort to ensure nobody slacks off. Lectures are pretty long but easy to follow, unlike other courses you won't need to watch them twice or look to outside resources.\n\nOverall quite easy, both in terms of difficulty and time involved. Also, the instructor Jacqueline is very kind and accommodating - if you want to pad your GPA without much effort or really want to learn more about balance sheets and statements of cash flows take this course. But if you want to do some in-depth analysis of different types of investments, learn how to predict how stock portfolios will behave, etc. you'll be disappointed by this. ",

And even if you are an excel beginner, the professor more or less walks you through just about everything anyway. \n\nSpeaking of the professor. I liked her. \n\nThe videos can run a little longer than what I've seen so far in other courses. And, you will have a team project (I hate team projects). Our team basically just all the the whole project and then compared notes. Then one of us would submit. \n\nMost interesting subject to me was the portfolio stuff where you try to optimize a portfolio to minimize risk free return using matrix algebra. I have never studied MPT or any of that, but I suspect this touched on the very basics of it. More of that, would be what I'd want to see. \n\nGood course, of the three business analytics track electives, this would probably be the most \"work\" but even still it's light compared to the omsa courses, let alone the cse ones.
