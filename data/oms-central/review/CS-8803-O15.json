                        "body": "Spring 2024 -- doubled this course with GA and found it to be very manageable, ended with a strong A. \n\nProf. Huffman and Prof. Omojokun are top-notch instructors. They make the course engaging and accessible. I found the course content to be pretty interesting and worthwhile. From my experience with startups, small business valuations (aside from team, and product-market fit) are heavily indexed on existing patents, IP, and copyrights. If you're ever planning to spin up your own tech company, I think this is a good introduction to some of the legal dynamics at play.\n\nCourseload is very manageable, but some expectations could be clarified better. For example, you must complete paper outlines before you submit the full thing, which gives you a chance to get TA feedback. I didn't realize these were actually graded (I think one of them was worth something like 8% of your total grade?), which caught me off guard. I actually had a higher grade in GA than this course for a good chunk of the semester. My advice is to go over the assignment instructions with a fine-tooth comb and make sure you hit everything that's being asked of you, because it's more of a rubric than topics to consider.\n\nDiscussions on Ed were graded, albeit pretty leniently compared to the written assignments. I saw some students clearly post copy/paste answers from ChatGPT (bulleted lists of vague responses and all), which I felt ambivalent about given the rigor of this program. My hope is that low-effort posts like that are policed more going forward.\n\nWeekly quizzes were pretty straightforward open-book/open-notes. A few tricky questions but pretty easy to get an +80. \n\nTAs were generally pretty good. Adrian seemed to be the one running the show and was very active and response on Ed. Seemed like a great guy.\n\nOverall I got what I wanted from this course and it paired nicely with a harder one. I'm giving it a 4/5 because I think a few kinks could be worked out with clearer assignment instructions and how the written assignments will be graded. Whenever I got grader feedback, it was usually (to paraphase) \"you're missing _____ section\" or a generic \"Nice job!\" which felt too formulaic. It'd be nice to get more detailed feedback if each section is going to be scrutinized in the grading.\n",

The majority of the grade is quizzes (30%), an acquisition project (25%), and a code analysis (35%) project.\nThe quizzes are weekly quizzes that relate directly to that module. The quizzes/modules are released at the start of each week, so you cannot work ahead.  The quizzes are multiple choice and while the information directly relates to the module, they can sometimes be tricky/ambiguous. \nThe assignments are pretty open-ended and do not include a rubric. This can make it challenging to know if you included everything required. Both assignments have an outline due, so it does help that feedback is provided on the outline. \nThe average time per week increases when the assignments are due, but my time estimate applies to the average week with a module/quiz. \nThere is also 10% of your grade based on class discussions on Ed Discussion.
