I expected this course to be an enjoyable, easy experience, like CS-6795 (Intro to Cognitive Science), but instead, it focuses on basic concepts and how AI agents mimic human behavior. Unfortunately, you'll spend your time on pointless tasks: 5 mini-projects, 3 homework assignments, 4 milestones for a major project, and 2 exams. Every week, you're also required to peer review three classmates' papers, but most people barely skim them for participation points. The projects are tedious and offer no real learning value\u2014you won\u2019t be working on anything cutting-edge or relevant to your future career. For each assignment, you\u2019ll end up writing around 5 pages, totaling 65-70 pages for the entire course. If you're serious about learning something that will advance your career, do not take this class. I wish I had read the reviews before enrolling.",

                        "body": "TLDR: Do NOT take this course - you will spend an incredible amount of time but learn next to nothing out of it.\n\nThis has been an absolutely worst class for me, not only in the program but probably among the other 20+ graduate courses I've taken throughout my life. There was maybe a course or two where I learned less but then they required much less work. There were courses with higher workload, but then I learned much more from them. This course feels like an incredible amount of busy but absolutely useless work. Even the lectures: very lengthy but with minimal breadth. A student in our class summarized the content of the entire course in a 19 page PDF and that was all in it. And even this summarized material has very little to no practical use.\nSome mini-projects and the course-long project were kind of fun to work on but they had nothing to do with the course material. \nAlso, keep in mind that each programming assignment should be accompanied with a write-up. On top of that, there are 3 homeworks that are purely write-ups.  So it feels that you are taking an English class, not a CS one. To complete the picture, the questions on the exams were also worded in an incomprehensible way.\nThe only good thing in this course for me was that working on the course-long project I got an intro to OpenCV that I wanted to learn.\nFinally, if you care about your grade (that I was not much though somehow managed to get an A), the written parts are graded absolutely arbitrarily and no re-grade request were acknowledged.

                        "body": "My Background: B.S. in CS from a reputable university. 4 YOE as a SWE. I've taken CS 7646 and 6310. I found CS 7646 was good preparation for this course, but consider CS 7646 more difficult than this one in many ways.\n\nCourse Performance: Safe 'A'.\n\nRecommended Background: Have Python experience before taking this course as its first projects require OOP Python from the get go with no build up. Know your graph algorithms - especially breadth-first search. There are courses on edX by Georgia Tech that can provide the required Python background for this course if you don't have prior experience.\n\nTips to Do Well in the Course: \n1.) To get full participation points when reviewing classmates' papers, use the grading rubric for the assignment to structure your response.\n2.) Write your project journals based off of the grading rubric for time efficiency and to ensure you cover all required items.\n3.) Scoring well on the final project's performance section will take way more effort than other assignments. Accept that your grade is going to take a hit on the final project and ensure you do well on all assignments before the final project.\n4.) For mini-projects you don't necessarily need to worry too much about efficiency. Try a simple, brute force approach first then seek to optimize your solution.\n5.) Take page-numbered notes during the lectures and organize them by a table of contents. Reference those notes and ctrl-f search the transcripts of the video lessons for exams for any questions you're unsure on. The timing of the exams was nice and not intensely pressured like many OMSCS courses.\n6.) Do Peer Feedback tasks and do them early. You get 3 times as many points for doing them early. Try to do as many as possible in the beginning of the course to frontload the workload for the course as much as you can.\n7.) Prioritize doing extra peer feedback tasks for the RPM project so you can learn from your classmate's approaches. Keep a google doc of notes of things you learn from your classmates that you may want to incorporate.\n8.) Participate in the EdDiscussions in ways that are enjoyable for you. For me that was answering classmates' questions and participating in the Wednesday Debates.\n9.) Pay attention to JDF format! Ensure your margins and font size are correct. They mostly care grade-wise if you're using margins or font sizes that allow you to write more than other students. Create a Google Doc template that follows JDF format and make a copy of this before each assignment to efficiently ensure you follow the required report format.\n10.) Monitor EdDiscussions. The course is set up to be very collaborative. Learn from your classmates and their posts.\n\nCourse Thoughts:\n\nThe course material is very interesting. Knowledge-based AI is more intuitive in that you can understand how an agent arrives at its answers. This course provides interesting methodologies to allow your agents (programs) to learn that differ from machine learning. The course feels like it supplements an algorithms course in that it explores problem-solving strategies and gives a more intuitive language to algorithms than I had encountered before.\n\nThe course is well-organized and the expectations are clear. The course has a demanding workload, but I would not say it's overly difficult as some of the posts here state. Start your assignments early and do not procrastinate. All course material and assignments are available from day one.\n\nCourse Critique:\n\n1.) The homework assignments are busy work. Their material is already covered by the mini-projects. I think the level of work for the course is appropriate except for these homework assignments.\n2.) The course project revolving around Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM) is really interesting! Unfortunately, the need to learn vision processing to apply the course concepts encourages much easier, gimmicky strategies that do much better. I think this course could be greatly improved if the vision processing necessary to create conceptual models and analogical mappings of the RPM problems was taught as part of the course. This would help students that want to take that approach to apply the concepts from the course more. Otherwise, the concepts from the course get rather disconnected from the final project through the use of DPR, IPR, and case recording which score extremely well but don't really apply course concepts. Meanwhile, actual vision processing based strategies applying the course concepts require way more work and don't perform as well."

The negatives here are as follows, the course provides no exxtra value than watching the  videos on youtube or without actually enrolling to the course. There are no office hours , tutorials nor TA engagment like other courses, grading is alway super late, and feedback is a few words so not helpful to learn from TA correction. Also course load is way more than the learning value as you have to write and review alot, which doesnt help the learning process as much as they portray it. This course relies on the fact that class participation is graded so that people help each other rather than TAs supportting which in my view didnt work much. Its easy to get an A if you put the effort although effort does weight well aganist the amount of learning. Last nitpick is you re betteroff implementing most projects from you prior algorithm knowledge than trying to implement philosphies in lecture and after just attempt to link them together which is also disappointing somewhat since course knowledge is not needed for any of the project even the final ravens project. for final project go for simple pixel and image difference approaches saves you so much effort and time from trying to apply course shape relationships and will get you a higher grade.",

I do have a decent amount of experience in software but not with Python, which is the language we used for all of our projects in this class. wrapping up with python and getting familiar with some of the libraries look some time but was not the main problem. This course has ALOT of weekly tasks which makes it a very difficult first class. On top of trying to get back into school, especially an online school, and learning how to use Python to deliver the projects which one is due almost every week, we had to write 5 page papers weekly, do at least 3 peer reviews, watch 2-3 lessons that were sort of boring, midterm, final, and a very difficult final project which we gradually build during the whole class timeline that hold a pretty big chunk of the overall grade .I had a 90% and it dropped to 86% because the TA gave me a super low grade on the paper, although I had been receiving mostly A's on all my papers. \n\nIts a good class, but I wouldn't suggest it as the first class due to overload of assignments due per week.",

The term-long project can be daunting at first, but was a fun challenge by the end of the term - it's very approachable if you build cleanly from the start and meet the milestones as recommended.\n\nThere was a fair amount of writing, probably 50-60 total pages of reporting in JDF throughout the course. This was my first time using the format and it's quite approachable. The rubrics for these assignments were very refined and it was easy to get full marks by referring to the rubric and assignment description - they explicitly state what they're looking for.\n\nLastly, the staff were extremely helpful and very organized. In contrast to some other courses, they're on another level in terms of successful course management.",

The main course project revolves around solving problems in \"Ravens Progressive Matrices\" (those IQ test type questions with 3 images, and you have to solve for the fourth one). This project was fun to screw around with, but it was not really related to any of the lectures. I was able to get ~70/96 by just screwing around with my own heuristics and not reading any papers that others were using to score higher.\n\nThe lectures themselves were pretty interesting and well organized. I wish I spent more time just listening to them for fun, but as I said it was hard to apply most of them to the main RPM project. There were six mini coding projects that related to the course materials that were pretty interesting and not too hard. There were some written homeworks as well which were more annoying than anything, but they were fine. \n\nThere was a lot of drama related to participation, but in my opinion it was extremely easy to get a high participation grade by just doing the reviews at the beginning of the week, requesting extra in the beginning, and posting on the forum for extra points. I got way more than the max points without even really thinking about it. \n\nEvery assignment involved a ton of writing, but it was never really that painful to get the assignments out. A lot of people had anxiety about how to score all of the points, but if you just read what they want you'll probably get most of the points.\n\nThe exam was kind of annoying, since it was worded confusingly, but we were allowed to use the course videos, transcripts, and Google/ChatGPT as well, so they were not too bad.\n\nIn the end, I assume most people taking this class are doing it for the interactive intelligence specialty, and don't really care about this review. But for what it's worth, the class was decently interesting, and not too hard even though it kept me busy. I'd recommend it for someone who wants to learn Python or for someone interested in cognition and how cognition concepts are applied with code. ",

If you do the same, you'll get 100 even if your quality of work is terrible. Tip: always overfit the visible autograder data as you will not be penalized. You can even hardcode it - just call it case-based reasoning.\n\nThere are homeworks, mini-projects, a major project with four milestone deliverables, exams, and a complicated engagement process all at once. None of these are well executed. Easy A it you do the assignments, but you will work hard and learn nothing. I advise strongly against taking this class.",

Here, the TAs are there for operational support, not to clarify questions about lecture content. This is pretty annoying since the lectures are very dated with poor audio and incorrect/incoherent captions.

I took HCI from Joyner and it was amazing, I thought this would be similar and it's complete polar opposite. \n\nI think you can see what this class use to be like and the elements are still there, but while the class has been updated, it hasn't culled away any of the content in 3+ years. It really is a constant barrage of assignments and things to do and its every single week. There is no break. Not even for Thanksgiving or for GT's fall break, and I know it's online but every Fall class I have taken before this gave some sort of breathing room. \n \nThis is the standard week for this class: 2-3 hour lecture videos. 3 peer review (which is graded by a computer and they swear it's not based on word count but it is), office hours, a coding assignment (some really small but most are very involved 300+ lines)  and a 5-page paper explaining your code. And to top it off you have to participate in the discussion board to receive participation points. \n\nAdditionally, you will get nickel and dimed on points for the rubric that the TA won't follow. I seriously had multiple custom deductions on assignments which at that point why even use a rubric. You can submit a regrade request but it's not as easy as just requesting it, you have to submit a doctoral thesis with a 3 page paper explaining why you got points taken off (and they swear that the TAs are not subjective, but again, they are)\n\nThe project is also terrible. In theory it sounds like a good idea, but the project literally comes down to more graphic analysis then it does AI. For the most part, everyone has the same idea of how to do things, but everyone's process is different. The exemplary examples they have are chosen based on what how well put together the paper looks but it's just for looks. Looking at some of the examples for help doesn't work because there are so many errors on them that you could find yourself coding in circles. \n\nTLDR: Skip this class unless you have a lot of free time on your hands and even then I would skip. Unless they cull away some of the fat and let the students breathe for a little bit this class is not worth it. \n\n",

The lectures would really benefit from some good code examples.  Everything is presented very abstractly and translating what they present into actual usable code is a pretty huge challenge most of the time.\n\nMini projects: usually not too bad, I usually solved these with algorithms I didn't learn in the course, because they don't really present many algorithms, mostly just abstract framework.\n\nRavens Project: Very hard, I thought this was an interesting project to think through, but they don't give you any magical easy way to approach it in the lectures.  I learned a lot about opencv/image processing.  Get started early, I kept expecting the lectures to give me some a ha moment on how to approach these problems, but there is no easy solution (except farming gradescope which some students figured out how to do and shared it on the forum, pretty disappointed about this actually, they said they will fix this issue next semester).  To get an A you are probably going to end up with a brute force agent with miles of if statements, unless you think up something clever,  I ended up using a nearest neighbor approach which wasn't bad to code and worked well enough to get a 75/96.  \n\nTests: Awful, open everything, but trying to find jargon specific to the class which you can't find in the text book and it might just be stated briefly in a lecture video.  Best way to study I think is to just watch the lectures over and over and take good notes.\n\nThis class feels hard for the wrong reasons: \n-getting nitpicked on writing assignment points, \n-tests that don't really reflect actual problem solving skills, mostly just understanding jargon.\n- ravens project is really hard and a fun challenge, but if some students figure out a gradescope farm you will be working your ass of while they get perfect scores for a hour or two of work (I didn't do this technique because it seemed like a complete waste of my time, not learning anything by doing this)\n-10% participation grade which is no cake walk to get, need to reliably do peer reviews by Tuesdays and comment on the forum a lot.",

Well-presented materials.\n\nAssignments: The assignments are similar in format to Harvard's CS50 AI course, but more challenging (No starter code is provided, but you have the freedom to choose any methods you prefer). Overall, they were interesting and well-connected to the lectures (if you choose to use the methods introduced in the lectures).\n\nFinal project: 70% of my time was spent on the final project because I really enjoyed the project. Most people spent much less time and still did well.\n\nGrading: Depends on your luck. Different TAs have different expectations. If you are assigned to a TA who interprets the rubric differently, you will get points deducted. This was what made this course stressful to a lot of people (You will find your heart beating at 150bpm whenever they release the grades).\n\nOverall, this is a well-designed course for someone new to classical AI. The course was enjoyable but I would recommend against taking the class because you can just watch the lecture videos online and do the assignments yourself. This would save you from unnecessary stress. (I give it a rating of 1 not because the quality was bad, but because I think there is really no need to enroll in the class.)",

If you're looking for a side class accompanying some big classes, or just looking to graduate, I would recommend it. Otherwise, I'd say you'll learn nothing.\n\nSome tips:\n1. For the RPM project, you have 3 milestones to work towards before submitting the final report. For each milestone performance score, even you could get 100% grade by solving half of the test problems, I still strongly encourage you to get them all if possible. That will save you a lot of effort on the final stage. \n2. Also for the RPM, make sure you come up with a way to effectively determine if two images are the same in the early milestones. Some images look the same, but in pixel-by-pixel they vary. This semester we have observed students using several ways, but none of them seem to work neatly. Most students are using a threshold.\n3. For each writings, just refer to the rubric. The rubric is comprehensive and clear. And that's the best part of this class."

Assignments can be worked on ahead of time. This course was really flexible in terms of scheduling. Work load is dispersed quite evenly throughout the semester (some of the final assignments are easier but at that point you should be working on your final project)\n\nCons:\nGrading can be quite subjective due to the nature of essays. The course videos appear related to the assignments, but they are related in superficial ways. Two snafus during the course lead to large disruptions in learning.\n\nThis class really needs the help of an involved professor.

You basically spend the whole semester solving problems each week using whatever algorithm you want but call it an \u201cAgent\u201d. The material is outdated and I am shocked that this is allowed in the curriculum of a top 10 graduate CS program.\n\nI\u2019d recommend for - students who have no/little software background and want an easy start and can tolerate material that will likely be irrelavent if you want to do anything with AI as well as students who just want an easy A to get MS credentials. Or if you like structured learning environments and want to pay to practice solving problems that you could just do on your own.\n\nI\u2019d NOT recommend for - students who genuinely want to learn something relavent in the AI space and can\u2019t tolerate wasting your time having to memorize and regurgitate outdated information so you can pass exams.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014DETAILED RATINGS----\n\nOrganization: Excellent\nThe organization and responsiveness of the TAs is excellent. At no point in the course was I stressed out because I awas unclear about something or left wondering for days/weeks. When tweaks were made, they were clearly communicated. (Unfortunately, however, you only have to get a B in a course to be a TA so many of them are not particularly knowledgeable. They are basically just glorified grading tools. Don\u2019t ask them a sophisticated question about\u2026.idk equivalent problem representations\u2026. or they will break and take points away for non-conformity lmao)\n\nGrading: Fair\nThere was nothing unreasonable or unexpected grading-wise if you know how to read the rubric and check the boxes.\n\nWorkload: Way too much busy work\nI probably work a bit slower than average and with the exception of the first assignment or two everything I did for this class felt like torturous busy work. I think to give us a break whey made the last few assignments easier and maybe some people appreciated that but I felt it was just more mindless work\u2026I\u2019d have preferred an actual dropped assignment or something so I can focus on research for a week and forget about class work.\n\n(Note - I can\u2019t say anything about the workload compared to other OMSCS courses as this is my first one)\n\nMaterial: Outdated and irrelevant in the AI space\nThis was the main frustration for me in this course. I do not care (more than I have to for survival) about social credibilitly. I care about learning and my efforts and research helping the world. This classes wasted 4 months of my time (hyperbole acknowledged) solving weekly problems I don\u2019t care about and watching 25 lectures that made me want to break my monitors. Whats hilarious is that if you used the methods we \u201clearned\u201d in class on the assignments, it would have made the assignments harder to do then just using simple heuristics and search algs. \n\nA much more appropriate name for this course would be \"Ancient AI\", \"Applied Algorithms\", \"Narrow AI\", \u201cTechniques for Dumb Robots\u201d, ...\u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\n\nThere are two intellectually distasteful things in this class for me 1) you have to learn the KBAI rebranding of existing concepts you already learn far more broadly and efficiently in other classes (ie. algorithms and data structures) and 2) the whole class is about various static algorithms that people have come up with in the past to solve AI problems that have produce terriblly narrow and non-extensible AI systems like those terrible phone robots that you have to get past to talk to real people about your problem. Sure, these systems work for some narrow applications but they are just static algorithms, not AI. Or like your Roomba\u2026.basically algorithms for dumb, narrow \u201cAI\".\n\nThere are enough actually challanging problems in the world that require understanding complex processes and so in a top tier program making students waste their time memorizing KBAI's rebranding of things they a) already know by another name or b) can learn in algorithms classes more efficiently is truly yuck. \n\nIn short, this class is a waste of brain space because its basically a rebranding of things you should already know if you take, math and other fundamental CS courses. If you want cognition, take a neuroscience or another course. Not this. Otherwise just math, algorithms, and a minimal degree of introspection regarding how your own brain works is all you need to know everything in this class.\n\nOne additional TIP because I like a level playing field for those who still decide to take this class after my glowing review:\nI (foolishly) completed my final project using IPR/DPR and a few little image processing techniques\u2026.but come to find out you can get 100% by just hardcoding all of the solutions and calling it \"learning by recording cases\u201d even though YOU are the one learning\u2026not your socalled \u201cagent\". *facepalm*\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nContext:\nBackground: Mech Eng and Software Eng\nFall\u201923 - KBAI: A",

Many of the mini-projects were a form of space-searches. The RPM project also seems promising, and I'd like to have focused more on it, but I just got a little bit burnt-out on the amount of coursework. I think people typically will say \"deal with it, you're getting a GaTech degree, etc...\" but in reality, less is more. People only have so much bandwidth, and additional assignments are diminishing (if not negative) returns. \n\nOutside of this, the course had a weird focus on catching cheaters. Much of the class was accused of cheating at one point on peer reviews (strangely). The teaching staff continued to double-down on this accusation, until they realized their errors, and retracted it. It was a very strange event overall. \n\nNot sure I would recommend this course without significant modifications. ",

For each assignment, you have to write ~4-5 pages of report (weekly), and that is too much for a course that is not AI. Each assignment is different and shallow in terms of learning. The course lectures are outdated and not useful nowadays. The grading is done by AI mostly, and I did not see a single comment on my submissions. The course will take a lot of time, and you will gain almost zero knowledge about AI. It is good for high-school kids, but not for MSc students in CS! I forgot to say that participation is mandatory and you have to write peer-review for others' assignments. This feedback takes so much time, and they are useless. I would call it 'abusing' student to assess submissions and grading based on their feedback reports (may save costs!). 10% for participation is insane, and there is no fun there. ",

I wish I could have the time during the summer to think about these abstract topics and apply these concepts in the Mini Projects and RPM Projects. But summer being very condensed it was not at all possible to do this. Most of my mini-projects were brute force approaches to solve the problem. \n\nIf you really want to apply these concepts, I would recommend a spring / fall semester as it is not possible in the Summer. I had to work 1-2 weeks ahead to keep up with the pace of the course.\n\nAssignments:\nThe course has 3 different types of assignment running parallel: The Mini Projects, the Homeworks and the RPM project.\nAll the assignments were easy with well layed out rubrics which helps to answer the questions. I lost marks mostly in Homework 2 and 3 as a lot of room to answer was left upon us Students, the lectures did not help much here.\n\nExams:\nExams were open book and easy. I have no complaints.\n\nOverall:\nI came in with little to no Python knowledge and was easily able to pick up the materials and RPM project on the go with lots of Google Searches, etc. This course is an easy course, I learnt a lot about Knowledge Based AI but I am not happy that I could not apply the concepts I wanted to for the RPM projects. I look forward to do this during my downtime.\n\nI wish they could condense the course in the Summer so we can apply the concepts learnt and not rush through the semester. I would recommend picking this during Fall/Spring as unlike other courses, no assignments/homeworks have been dropped.\n",

Joyner's file format is a joke. Joyner is also a terribel teacher, trying to connect everything in the lecture to RPM, which makes zero sense. \n4. serious questions questioning lecture videos/notes don't get answers from teaching team.

Most projects could be brute forced, a lot of writing that seemed fairly pointless, Joyner Peer Feedback which was almost always useless forms of \"good job\" from fellow classmates. I will say I really appreciated everything being unlocked right away, I powered through lectures and assignments usually being 3-4 weeks ahead of schedule on work. Taking this class in the summer was pretty manageable. I got basically 100 on all mini projects and homeworks. 94/110 on Exam 1 and 92/110 on Exam 2 and 64/96 for the semester long final project with 50/50 on the final project writeup. This secured a solid A for me. If you know python, you are probably fine for the class, as you see even a meh score on the final project doesn't drag you down too much. Just stay up to date on the schedule (or work ahead). I wish there was slightly more challenging homework that really required application of AI rather than brute force algorithms that you pitch as AI in your reports. Literally with any approach you take, just follow the rubric and drop some keywords and you score full points. The Artificial Intelligence course in OMSCS is much harder but much more informative in terms of AI techniques and approaches. I expected more from this class, but oh well, it was an easy enough A for me. ",

                        "body": "I'm reviewing this class after receiving an \"A\" grade for the Summer 2023 term. Overall I had a positive experience with this course.\n\n- This class could very easily be renamed \"Applied Computer Vision\" or \"Applied Algorithms\" considering the main RPM project, and mini-projects, respectively. The lectures do not go into any detail about OpenCV / Pillow / NumPy, so expect a very \"hands-on\" style deep-dive into these topics. The class also expects a decent familiarity with Python and about good programming principles in general.\n\n- You probably shouldn't take this course during the summer. While it's possible to get an A, it will probably interfere with your life more than you want it to, and you will not have as much time to grasp the concepts in the lectures. Many of the assignments will feel rushed, and there are some weeks where both a homework / mini-project / exam is due the same week as as an RPM milestone; this is not ideal.\n\n- Dr. Joyner, as usual, does an amazing job at administering the course, and allows students many opportunities for grade improvement. As is usual with his courses, expect the extra work of giving Peer Feedback every week. You will also find yourself looking on the EdStem forums a lot for this course, not only for the extra participation threads, but also for the assignments themselves (more on that later).\n\n- The weakest point of this class is the lectures. Dr. Ashok Goel was the initial creator of the course, and Dr. Joyner is a co-host of the lectures. The lecture material does not really help while doing the assignments. Most of the material is very conceptual, and only a few of the lectures series have a real, technical description of an algorithm you should use on an assignment. I found this disappointing because the lectures became a chore every week. Instead of learning the material I would later apply in an assignment, it felt like I was learning the theory for the sake of learning the theory.\n\nMy recommendation to the course maintainers was for them to drop somewhere between 33 - 40% of the lecture videos, and with that remaining space, create new lecture videos which focus on implementation. The course covers so many topics that it does feel a bit overwhelming. Those videos in the 33 - 40% felt to me like topics which I only needed to know for the exams, and nothing else. It would be nice if the course could give some basic ideas / tutorials on computer vision fundamentals, and about how actually useful parts of the course material can be implemented in code.",

All the material is available on day 1 so you can work ahead but there are weekly discussions on the topics assigned for the current week. \n\nAll of the projects can be built based on the material from the class, at least conceptually. in practice, you will need some knowledge of Python but nothing that you can't learn as you take the course. \n\nThe main project involves image processing but is very light and you could even go ahead without it.

If I can do it, I promise you can\n\nPros:\n\n- The programming assignments are somewhat challenging but extremely doable. The lectures give you everything you need to solve the projects. If you're stuck you can also check Ed Discussion where someone will definitely have posted a high-level description of the solution (this helped me so much!)\n\n- Lectures are really engaging (as long as you haven't fallen behind and are binging them)\n\n- Helpful student engagement and discussion in Ed Discussion\n\nCons:\n\n- While I really enjoyed the semster long project, it kind of felt like there was the \"one way\" to do it with IPR/DPR. I know that's not true, but it really felt that way. I wish the lectures and the RPM problems were closer to each other."

Knowledge-Based Artificial Intelligence is focused on (3) - how can we design AI agents that think like humans? With that in mind, this course has significant overlap with cognitive science and philosophy in an effort to understand how humans think. The lectures fly at a pretty high level, but I found them interesting and thought-provoking. Many folks mention the writing assignments as a drawback to this course, but it's to be expected in a Joyner course and I think it's perfectly reasonable for graduate-level coursework. A lot of the writing is focused on communicating your problem solving approach for homework assignments, which I consider to be an essential skill. It doesn't really matter how slick your algorithms are if you can't explain to anyone how they work.\n\nOverall, I would recommend taking KBAI. I didn't have any prior experience with AI, so this was a nice introduction to the field. You'll definitely improve your Python skills, and you'll get your feet wet with rudimentary NLP and computer vision. I really enjoyed the semester-long RPM project because I got to learn more about NumPy and OpenCV.\n\nWith that said, I will agree with a prior comment about how KBAI feels like the \"underwater basket weaving\" of AI. Throughout the semester I couldn't quite get past the fact that it all felt too high level and simplistic. It was a very unique time to take this course because it happened smack in the middle of the ChatGPT explosion, and so I couldn't escape the feeling that the little logic problems presented in the assignments fall short of what \"real AI\" looks like. If you're looking to dive deep into algorithms, AI or ML might be a better choice.",

                        "body": "I thoroughly enjoyed how KBAI combines writing and programming to create a well-informed understanding of AI at a high level. The course is structured around three major assignment types: Mini-Projects that leverage a particular AI strategy to solve programming problems in Python; written assignments that require analysis of AI topics and their application to real-world scenarios; and a semester-long project on using Python to engage in image transformation detection for solving Raven's Progressive Matrices. These assignments rotated weekly, which I felt was helpful in ensuring that I didn't get burnt out on a particular topic.\n\nI found myself extremely overwhelmed by KBAI at the start of the course but eventually found a groove that made the workload manageable. The first Mini-Project was significantly more difficult for me to complete than any other assignment - I ended up with a 50-something on GradeScope and seriously contemplated withdrawing from the course only 2 or 3 weeks in. That said, once I better understood the requirements for each of the Mini-Projects and major project milestones, the work became almost trivial. Prior knowledge of Python is a major plus that will help you significantly throughout this course. \n\nMany reviewers of this course have branded its lecture videos as a distraction from the actual course content, and generally I tend to agree. The lectures cover various problem-solving and knowledge topics at a high level but never provide details on how they could be implemented in a programming environment; I found some lectures to be more useful than others in terms of guiding me toward solutions. Knowledge of the lecture video content is only truly necessary for the written Homework assignments and the 2 exams.\n\nThe real secret to success in this course lies in community participation: go-getter students are very eager to share how they completed particular assignments or problems, allowing you to skip over the process of deliberating how to solve such problems and instead focus on implementation. I highly recommend lurking around Ed if you are stuck on something.\n\nThis course rewards those who are either: a) willing to dedicate significant hours to coming up with original solutions; or b) clever at making most of the resources offered to them and not obsessing over a perfect score. You can easily maintain a high grade by being deliberate about which assignments you're capable of getting a 100 on and letting these pad some of your lower-performing code submissions. I finished with a mid-90s final grade despite earning a 76/100 on my final project's performance.",

Took a 5-6 year break from school and currently work as a Software Developer professionally.\n\nOverall:\nThis course is a great introductory course for those who took a long break from undergrad or for those who want to get better at programming without taking a deep dive into highly complex topics. All the mini-projects and main project require you to use Python. From my personal experience, I took most of the time (for the first month) trying to understand how to set up Python and getting used to the differences in syntax compared to C#. Also, an initial lack of knowledge in NumPy, PIL, and OpenCV libraries, which are essential for the Final project, significantly increased development time for the Project Milestones. Although the Homeworks are basically long essays, I found them to be the least time consuming assignments of the course. I struggled in this course initially because a lot of the mini-projects required knowledge in different data structures, which I lacked, and had to play catch up to eventually get an A in the course. Mini-Project 2 and 3 were the most difficult assignments, based on my experience, so do not get discouraged if you score low on those. \n\nTips:\n\u2022 Use the course forum if you feel like you are struggling in the programming assignments. (The other students in the course are very helpful and give great advice)\n\u2022 Try to write additional peer feedbacks if you don't plan to be active in the forum. (I found I had to play catch up towards the end of the semester for my participation points)\n\u2022 Play around with the Python libraries that are used for the RPM project when you have free time. (It will help lower development time for your project)\n\u2022 Focus on the rubric for the assignments rather than longevity.\n\nWhat I got out of the course:\n\u2022 I improved on my Python programming\n\u2022 Learned different ways to approach problems\n\u2022 Better understanding of the importance of planning\n\u2022 Better awareness of time requirements for a Graduate course\n\nI would definitely recommend this course as an introductory course for the OMSCS program based on the overall good experience I had.",

My CS background is limited, and my work does not use python. \nWith that being said, a great first course! I enjoyed the jumpstart into programming in python, and the class has a great discussion forum that is very lively. I had to get used to the flow, you typically have to write ~4 pages a week on homework, and have to work on creating a working code that is submitted to be graded.\nThe beginning of the course did require a lot of work, the first coding project took me 15 hours to complete but only because my programming was rusty and needed to get up to speed. After that initial kick I got the hang of it, and really enjoyed how goofy some of the project was. I will say after each exam I felt like I didn't learn much about KBAI as some of the definitions were hard to pick up from the lessons. This course to me was more about the enjoyment I got from the homework, mini-projects, and final. \nHighly recommend to anyone who is in a similar boat and wants to dive in. Be warned, I did say 13 hours a week, but in the beginning I did have some 20-25 hour weeks, but towards the end I had some 4-5 hour weeks to balance it out. And yes I am a nerd and kept track of all my time, the actual average was 12.3 hours, but decided to round up to be on the safe side if someone is trying to plan out a semester workload.",

It is open book/note/lecture/everything, but I realized how little I learned in this class.\n\nPros:\nEverything is released right away.  All assignments are online, so you can get started whenever you want (barring those assignments changing for the next semester).\n\nProfessor is active in the forums but that should be the norm, not a pro.\n\nLots of graded assignments to cushion the blow if you do poorly on something.\n\nCons:\nLectures are just high level and hand wavy.  Examples that are abstract to the point of being absurd.  \"Suppose a robot wants to buy a cup of coffee\".  That stuff is just laughable. This content has nothing to do with the mini-projects or RPM.  MPs can almost be solved with a search algorithm (BFS), other MPs you can just hack something together.\n\nYou can get 70% performance on RPM with affine model, DPR/IPR hacks and a look up table.  No reason to go beyond that since you'll lose only a couple points on your final grade.\n\n80% is the average success rate for students on RPM performance, rarely anyone gets 100%.  So your grade is penalized by virtue of tackling the problem.  80% performance should be 100% of that part of the grade.\n\nSome of the homework questions were tangential and not with-in the scope of the class.  But it is easy busy work to pad your grade, so maybe a pro.\n\nCognitive Science is just pseudo-philosophy.  Unfortunately, this class is just that with a sprinkling of AI and not the other way around.  KBAI feels like the underwater basket weaving of AI.  Maybe interesting to think about (if that is your thing) but completely useless in the real world.\n\nMy $0.02:\n\nThis class failed since it didn't teach me anything.  That is what I learned on the final exam.  Just topics that you watch a video for, take some notes and you'll probably forget a week or two after the semester is done.  I wish this class showed some actual application to the real world.  How does KBAI tie into Chat GPT? Does Boston Dynamics implement KBAI into their robots?  Those kinds of things.\n\nI recommend checking out the course page and see if this is something of interest before you register.  It is an easy class to get a B and fulfill the Interactive Intelligence specialization requirement, but kind of a waste of time when you could be learning something useful or that would apply to your future career.  I feel like I left AI having learned new skills but I leave KBAI wondering if I should have just taken ML instead.",

They're short and sweet but you'll also learn a lot from them, I felt they're changing the way I think.\n-Exams are reasonable, not too hard, not too difficult for someone watched all the lectures.\nCons: Pretty much everything else :) \n-Every single week you have to write a journal, but the issue isn't in writing them as much as how they get graded. During the whole semester, so many students complained on ED that they didn't get graded fairly which is kind of true, your grade depends on how nice the TA is and they're all subjective so it's hard to argue against it. For some reason the professor didn't get engage in any of those threads.\n-TAs are there to review those journals, they're rarely engaged in anything would truly help the students.\n-The projects are silly and you don't need AI to solve them, they're all solvable through brute force, in fact, I haven't seen anyone else in the class solving them in a different way based on the journals which I had to review during the peer review process.\n\nLong story short, take that class if you don't have other options, otherwise, watch the videos of the class on your own, they're available online for everyone.\n",

What free will is. What a joke is.\n\nThis class is a joke. Every homework is just busy work. Here's a great line from the prompt for home work 3:\n\nAs we all know, our appreciation for literature is only increased when we painstakingly tear it apart and analyze it like a chemical compound, so let\u2019s do that here\u2014and save pondering how to design an AI agent that can understand the sarcasm of that sentence for another day.\n\nNo! Professor, are you serious? No! I am in a Comp Sci program. I am a professional with a life. This isn't funny. This is you looking your student in the face and saying \"im making you do unrelated busy work instead of what you came here for, and I'm going to laugh at you about it.\" This is every homework.\n\nI hate this class. It makes the whole OMSCS program feel like a bad joke of an online school. I literally lost points today because a TA didn't like how I defined what a hotdog is. Are you kidding me? In a masters level grad program about computer science?\n\nThe first thing I ever programmed on my own was an if-then stupid little program to play blackjack. Turns out that was actually masters level work because Joyner was happy to assign an UNO if-then stupid little program as homework (and then call it an \"AI agent\" lol). This class is a literal insult to the intelligence of its students.\n\nBut at least we get cool AI based homeworks right?\n\nNO. NO, YOU REALLY DONT.\n\nFor every assignment you can just brute force your way to perfect score, and what's more, that's usually the best way to do it. The lectures are full of stuff about AI that only gets applied when students drop buzzwords from lectures to try to satisfy TAs who want to see us \"apply what we learned\". In other words, replacing the word \"class\" with \"frame\" and \"variable\" with \"slot\". Boom, you can do AI now.\n\nThe TAs for this class have no business deciding if I defined free will sufficiently at a masters level. I have no business trying to do so at a masters level. I'm not here for philosophy, I super don't care what Joyner or his TAs feel about free will. Like, at all. And if they care what I think then they're even more bonkers than I thought. What even is this class?\n\nI don't know. I'm never taking another Joyner class again.",

                        "body": "This was my first course in the program. I feel comfortable writing this review six weeks before the end of the semester as I have fully explored all the course content, submitted all my code, and submitted almost all of written work. I currently have a 98 in the course and fully expect to maintain an \u2018A\u2019. This is a relatively easy course if you have a background in CS, but make no mistake, it is time-consuming. I was only able to work ahead because I have significantly more time than the average student to put toward schoolwork.\n\nPROS:\n--\tThe content of the course is interesting. It feels like a cross between an intro to AI and an intro to cognitive science. I learned a lot from the different concepts covered in the lectures, from semantic networks, to incremental concept learning, to analogical reasoning. If you\u2019re interested in the nature of intelligence and minds/possible minds, you\u2019ll probably find this stuff fascinating.\n--\tThe lectures are well produced and easy to consume. I think this is the case with most courses in the program, but like I said, this is my first course, so I really appreciated it.\n--\tBecause the course is popular and has such a high student capacity, Ed was always very active. Every question asked was answered quickly and satisfactorily by a fellow student or a TA. Communicating with others on Ed was actually one of my favorite parts of the course. I learned a lot just from these interactions.\n-- David Joyner. I just love the guy.\n-- The programming was pretty fun. If you\u2019re looking for something on the easier side, are just getting started in the program, or don\u2019t have much background in CS, the projects are a good way to get some exercise with python and maybe a little numpy.\n--\tThe exams are fair and very well put together. No gotchas, no ambiguity (that I saw), and the difficult level was appropriate for an open-note, open-internet format\u2013challenging but not too hard. That said, I think I would have preferred a somewhat easier, closed-note exam format. I personally learn more that way. \n\nCONS:\n--\tI\u2019m not sure how directly useful the course content is in industry. This isn\u2019t a euphemism; I\u2019m honestly not sure. Judging from what others have said (I\u2019m not in tech professionally yet), these concepts probably fall on the lower end of practicality. However, I still think they\u2019re useful at a high level when considering what the properties of a truly intelligent agent are.\n--\tThe programming assignments, including the central Raven\u2019s Progressive Matrices project, don\u2019t require you to use the course material and thus end up not complementing the course the way they should. To me, this is the biggest flaw of the class. Your program results are auto-graded, so as long as your output gets you across the finish line, whatever got you there doesn\u2019t matter. Most people in my experience wised up quickly to easy visual heuristics (DPR/IPR and others) they could get away with to solve RPM problems. For the mini-projects, there were a handful of people who worked ahead very quickly, figured out short cuts to solving them all, and then described the easiest solutions on Ed. Others will rightly point out that when it comes to learning you get out what you put in, but when you\u2019re assigned 4-8 pages to write every single week, it\u2019s hard to not take the easy path when it\u2019s sitting right there in front of you. Speaking of which\u2026\n--\tThere\u2019s just too much writing. Some of the writing is fun (I had a blast writing about consciousness for homework 3), but the RPM journals get tedious. There are four milestone journals PLUS the big writeup for the final project. This is in addition to writeups for each of the five mini-projects, the three (long) homeworks, AND the peer feedback you have two write each week. I much rather would have spent more time coding.\n\nOverall, I\u2019m right on the fence with recommending or not recommending this course. Would I take it again? In its current form, I don\u2019t think so. It\u2019s just way too easy to not learn very much, and I wish there were more mechanisms in place to hold students\u2019 feet to the fire. However, if you\u2019ve got time to put the work in and feel you won\u2019t succumb to the temptation of taking the easy route on assignments, I can imagine this being a rewarding experience.",

                        "body": "KBAI was one of the best courses I've ever taken, and I highly recommend it for anyone who REALLY wants to learn how to think differently about complex problems (both in AI but also in a general technical atmosphere). Let me list the pros and cons below.\n\nPros:\n\u2022 You learn a LOT. From the moment you enter the class to the day you leave, you are constantly learning about the parallels in how humans think and how we can mimic AI machines to think like us! Very fascinating stuff.\n\u2022 The course project is for sure a shiny badge for your resume. The semester-long Raven's Progressive Matrices Agent that you build will definitely teach you a lot about the course subjects, but it'll also look really good on your professional profiles or resume! Even if your Agent isn't in the top percentile, the learning you do and all the code you write for it over the semester is for sure an achievement regardless. \n\u2022 The Mini-Projects allow you to improve your coding. I knew programming decently well coming into this class, but after completing the coding projects needed, my python programming skills have improved drastically! \n\u2022 The sense of community on Ed is like nothing else. Seriously, the Ed forum was a lifesaver for this class. The professor and TA pretty much always foster a community of learning and making mistakes and helping eachother out. I can't recall a single time where they took down a post where students were helping eachother think about problem solving techniques and offering advice. You could tell that most of the teaching staff wanted students to succeed and help one another.\n\u2022 In my personal opinion, I think it's extremely important to have good written communication skills as a developer, and with all the reports you write in this course it definitely gives you the opportunity to work on and hone those skills. Writing reports for every single project can seem annoying at times, but I assure you'll come out a better writer! \n\u2022 You can tell the Professor loves this course and is dedicated to student success. Dr. Joyner is amazing at what he does, and it's clear throughout every point in this class. From the weekly assignment reminders, to the fun engaging lectures, and the occasional responses on Ed posts, I liked knowing I was in a class where I felt appreciated and valued as a student. \n\u2022 You WILL get out from this course what you put IN. If you make a decent effort to learn the concepts, complete the course project, and all the other assignments, you will come out of this class feeling like a different person. You will be equipped with a huge toolbelt of knowledge to go and tackle problems you never thought you could before. I came in knowing nothing about computer vision, and now I'm able to do technical analysis on images and process pixel counts and use those to make assumptions about what an image is showing me... very cool stuff!\n\u2022 You have the ability to work ahead! The thing I loved the most about this course was having the entire class given to you day one. You have a syllabus and deadlines for assignments, but you as a Student are able to pick how far ahead you want to work. This saved me so many times while working fulltime, because there were weeks where work or sickness caught hold of me but I had worked 2-3 weeks ahead and so I was seldom worried about my assignments. If you can, I HIGHLY implore you to get ahead wherever you can in this class. Some students worked so far ahead they got the entire month of December off and to themselves. So keep that in mind when taking this class.\n\nCons:\n\u2022 Lecture Exercises are somewhat outdated (it can get kind of annoying because by the end of the semester I wasn't even actively doing them as I knew most of the results would be wrong anyways). Just focus on the lectures themselves.\n\u2022 Not necessarily a con, but rather a warning. You REALLY need to be a competent programmer. I don't recommend this class for anyone just learning how to code. A lot of the projects in this class require intensive programming.\n\u2022 Grading isn't very standardized. I only encountered this issue towards the very end of the course, but despite my reports being extremely similar in structure and format from week-to-week, some TA's may take that as a 100, and other TA's may take that as a 75. \n\u2022 Exams are fair, but my only hesitance with them is the way the questions are worded. I don't know how non-native english speakers even take them, as being one myself made it extremely difficult to understand the question wording a lot of the time. Hopefully they improve that in the future but for now, question wording can get really convoluted and you'll spend 2-3 minutes just deciphering what the question is asking. (Exam times are also on the shorter side so beware of that).\n\u2022 Peer Reviews did not help. In this class you're required to submit peer reviews for others' reports as part of participation. For one, most of the peer reviews I got didn't help me at all, but also in my cohort it actually caused issues in regards to retaliation. Students who took critical feedback would then go and \"reputation strike\" other students, which I think at the end caused a lot of issues that could be avoided outright if reviews are abolished or at least give reviewers option to remain anonymous.

I loved the concepts of thinking about problem solving and the direct links between human cognition and the algorithms implemented by computer \"AI agents\".  It really expanded how I think about computer program design and the parallels to human thinking/problem solving.  The programming itself wasn't too difficult.  I improved my python skills immensely - but YMMV. My biggest complaint was the writing components - the weekly papers covering your program did become a bit of a chore.

                        "body": "Before I begin my review, I should let you know that I am not in the OMSCS program. I am in the C-track (Computational Data Analytics) for the OMSA program and took this course because C-track students have to take 2 CS courses for the program. This course got one of the better reviews of the ten CS course options listed for the C-track electives, so I decided to take this course. I'm disclosing this to let you know that I do not come from a pure CS background like most people that take this class, just to give you a heads-up.\n\nNow for the review. To put it simply, this class just has way too much going on. I knew going into this class that there would be a decent amount of writing because a lot of the reviews on here mentioned it. But what most of those reviews don't mention is EXACTLY how much writing there is, which is what I am going to tell you right now so that you know. Don't say I didn't warn you.\n\nExcluding the 2 exams, there are 13 assignments in total for this course, with all of them requiring a write-up. Here are the page total requirements for the assignments:\n\n- 5 papers for a semester-long coding project: 5 pages per paper for the first 4, and then up to 10 pages for the 5th one.\n- 5 papers for 5 different coding mini-projects: Up to 4 pages per paper\n- 3 papers for 3 different theory-based homework assignments based on lecture material: Up to 6 pages per paper (4 pages recommended)\n\nIn total, I did roughly 65 pages of paper writing for this course. I should note that not every page was all text. You are asked on some papers to include figures/diagrams, which can take up at least half of a page a lot of the time. But there was definitely more text than figures in my papers.\n\nA paper is due every week, first thing Monday morning. And THEN you have to give peer feedback to 3 different students' papers that are randomly assigned to you for each of the 13 assignments. And the peer feedbacks that you submit are graded. If a student's paper meets all of the rubric's expectations and is really good, you can't simply write \"This was a great submission and it met all of the expectations. Great job!\" You will get a bad grade for that. You have to go into great detail and write in paragraphs why that student's submission was really good in order to get a good grade on your feedback, which I thought was redundant busy-work.\n\nAll of this writing makes it incredibly easy to fall behind on the lecture videos, which are fairly interesting but they're only helpful for the exams in my opinion. I thought there was a pretty big disconnect between the lecture material and the coding assignments for this course. They were incredibly high-level \"whiteboard\" explanations that didn't really give any good algorithm breakdowns or coding whatsoever. I literally didn't use any of the concepts covered in the course for the semester-long project because the project was too big and complex for any of these concepts to be applicable. And this seemed to be the class consensus based on discussions in the class forum. I would encourage you to pay attention to the discussions in the class forum because students share methods that they implemented in their mini-projects and semester-long project that really helped them out, and I found that to be pretty useful.\n\nThere's also no starter code for any of the coding assignments in this class - I didn't find this to be a big deal seeing as it is a grad-level CS course, but I figured I would just let you know this ahead of time as well.\n\nThe one good thing about this class is that because there are so many assignments in the course, everything is weighted pretty evenly and lightly. So doing really poorly on one assignment is not gonna affect your grade that much. I got roughly 60% on the semester-long project for this course and I'm either going to barely get an A or easily get a B in the course.\n\nIn terms of coding, I would say it is on the easier side for OMSCS students (it's all in Python, by the way). But my final advice to you regarding this course is this: if you are not required to take this course for your program, you need to SERIOUSLY consider whether you are willing to do a ton of excessive writing - between assignment write-ups, peer feedback, and coding - for a 4-month period. Because that's what you're gonna spend the vast majority of time doing in this course.",

The course material was easy to understand and digest. The projects were pretty great and while we had to think about them, they weren't that difficult to solve or submit. The TAs were really generous and helped out a lot. For an online student, the best tool that we used was Ed Discussions and Peer Feedback, as these were a semblance of actually interacting with the class. The students were extremely helpful and may be due to participation points, were really supportive throughout. \n\nThere was not much I didn't like, but I would definitely say that this was a time-consuming class. Weekly Projects, Reports, and Submissions without any breaks were extremely exhausting. Even if I missed one week, I would lose a grade. Not saying that a Masters's Course should be any less rigorous but this is something the student should expect from this class. \n\nThe only reason for bumping difficulty from 3 to 4 is to keep it aligned with the strict time-bound activities we need to perform. Overall I had the most fun in this class and would recommend students to take this class.\n",

There is too much writing. \nThere is an assignment due basically every Sunday midnight (except exam weeks). Nearly every assignment is 50% Gradescope performance and 50% write up. If you bomb an assignment, it's not the end of the world.\n\nThe write-ups are really not bad, and very manageable for graduate level coursework. Maybe 3-4 hrs spread over the week. \n- Use a latex template (Overleaf is very easy) from the beginning. \n- Stick to the posted rubric. \n- Make plots / tables as you do the projects. You'll find yourself hitting the page limit in basically every write-up. \n- Don't wait till Sunday to write it or you'll hate every moment. \n- The peer reviews on your write up are actually quite motivating. \n\n2. They don't teach you how to program. \nYeah, not really. This isn't a programming class, it's a graduate-level classical AI course. They cover a range of topics on a high level, then toss you interesting projects to get your hands dirty. The discussion forums offer plenty of help if you're struggling. (there is usually an easy way to complete a project, but it's fun to try some exotic stuff out).\n\n3. This is all outdated anyway.\nI never understand this take. A survey of classical AI techniques is going to broaden your understanding of the field and give you a wider base of approaches to apply to future problems.\n\nThere isn't a clear 1:1 relation from classical AI to modern data-driven approaches. But if you really can't fathom how to use anything but deep learning to solve problems, you're part of the problem.    \n\n\nTo wrap up:\nIf you're here to learn and want a good class to sink your teeth into (that isn't going to absolutely kill you); you're in the right place. \n\nIf you're here to get in and get out, well, its not crazy hard and you can get by with just skimming the lectures. You might actually enjoy it, so be careful of that. \n\nThe class felt a little front loaded. It's progression and organization are great, but they jump right into it with the first project. If you're not comfortable programming you'll have to learn quickly.\n\nYou'll have to be pragmatic with your time to get projects finished. Get a basic, working version submitted early before scaling it up.  \n\nI absolutely recommend this class. But don't take it if:\n- You don't have at least a functional knowledge of python or object oriented programming. Learning this right before the class is going to be a hard sell unless you're comfortable in similar languages. \n\n- You want a theory class. This is basically all projects and not much math. \n\n\n",

It's my first class in the program too.\n\nLet's start with the negatives of the class. First, speaking as a writer, there is a LOT of writing. Heed this warning. You will be programming a lot, AND writing a lot, AND reviewing people's writing a lot. This is a class that demands 50% of your energy for writing + reading and 50% for programming. If you're okay with this, then that's awesome. If not, then you should consider a class that doesn't require you to write so extensively. I think I've written about 30 pages worth of stuff by now, and it's been only a month.  \n\nThe second thing, which is more serious--there have been a LOT of criticisms regarding how, despite a large number of our assignments requiring us to program extensively, there are very little to no programmatic algorithms introduced to us in the class. Which is a little awkward, considering many people recommend KBAI as a first class for people--in this sense, it's probably better as a second-semester class. \n\nThere's sooo many people who say \"This is grad school. Don't expect to be spoonfed anything.\" but this criticism isn't coming from people who want to be spoonfed. It's coming from people who want, literally, perhaps a page from Russel & Norvig or a link to some reference for generic pseudocode and programmatic explanations. There are absolutely NO guidelines at all on how to program some of the algorithms presented in the course! I would be incredibly surprised if you could prove me wrong on this! \n\nI personally have had to do the added research of perusing Russell and Norvig, as well as the optional readings from our Winston textbook and studying relevant data structures that may outline how to approach the assignment, in order to get an A. \n\nIf you take this, PLEASE be aware that you will not receive any help from the lectures themselves on how to approach programming assignments, much less learning Python! I use Python at my job on the regular, and I cannot imagine taking this course if you've never used Python! \n\nAs for the positives, there are many. Perhaps as a result of writing all of these reports, if you take this as a first class into the program, you will have set up a good process + environment for writing papers in the future. All of the assignments are given to you at the start of the semester, so you can plan ahead as needed. TAs are incredibly responsive; exams are fair. Programming exercises, if you know how to program beforehand at least, illuminate the concepts in the lecture very well. They are also very flexible exercises--you aren't being shoehorned into a very specific technique or method in order to get 100%. \n\nI just don't know if these positives can outweigh this HUGE, GLARING negative point. I think it wouldn't be so serious if the course instructors themselves emphasized that it would be very, very important to have prior understanding of Python and a basic grasp of data structures, or suggest as optional reading some more technical papers that outline a programmatic approach to some of the algorithms from lecture, or at the very least a few chapters from the AI textbook by Russell and Norvig. \n\nI struggled to get a grasp for the class at the beginning of the semester because of how lost I felt for our first programming assignment, but I was able to figure things out by reading a lot more and doing my own research, so I'm much more comfortable now. But there are still a lot of students I've seen in the discussion forums and in our peer reviews who are struggling with completing the programming exercises because they are very genuinely lost, and it's hard to blame them.

For example, in Homework 1 Question 2, it asks to read some European Regulations, and how it applies to general AI, etc. which is completely irrelevant to the course. (More like an ethical course topic)\n3. Again, maybe because of the boredom of this course, it asks to complete weekly reports and so-called peer feedback.\n\nOverall, this is a very tedious course teaching useless content.

Major chunk of the marks is reports for the projects which are easily to do if you just follow the grid.\n\nNegatives-\n1) Course is not relevant to modern day AI, or something which will help you at work (or secure a new job)\n2) Re-stressing again on the above negative, very theoretical and intuitive topics discussed in the course, not directly applicable in your programming\n3) Although the projects are good at building fluency and logic, they are general programming challenges and independent of the course lectures to a certain extent. You can use common sense, any algorithm, or force the course topics into the projects but this is reinforces my above contention that the topics are not relevant to modern programming\n4) Every week or so a paper is due, can find it a bit too much\n5) Exams tested less of conceptual learning and were more focussed on command over English language to decipher the 'tricky worded' questions",

If you are someone who can only learn topics by coding them, this class might not help you to learn. The test cases for the projects are fairly simple so your code can be inefficient and use basic search instead of the topics taught in the class. The workload is a lot compared to other classes. There is often a coding assignment, report about the coding assignment, homework essays, and lectures to complete during the week. There are also exams, which are thankfully open notes, and a semester-long project that will require a lot of time to complete. I would say this class is not difficult but tedious and an unnecessary amount of work to learn the topics. Overall, I would recommend taking this class if it satisfies a requirement but finding an easier class if you do not have a lot of time during the week for assignments. ",

The good side is the grading is reasonable. As long as you write something that make sense, you are expected to get full score. The Final RPM seems a duplicate of previous 4 RPM, but has a substantial weight of 15%, equal to two exams. It is very helpful to read through previous reviewers to have some expectation. I had thought this is a easy course and didn't start work on projects until late of wk2, and have felt some pressure to keep up.I personally think the 3 homework is simply waste of time or weighted too much. 5% each, and I usually have to spend a whole week to finish writing. Also, reviewing 6 papers from your peers every week is also not making much sense.  I felt less motivated to prepare for exam 2.

                        "body": "**Background**: Chemical Engineering w/minimal python experience\n\n**Workload**: as a non-CS background, this was a good first coding class in the OMSCS program. The mini-projects are challenging, but my coding has improved immensely. Like I look at my first project and can not believe how far I've come understanding and utilizing classes for object oriented programming. The caveat is that I spent a lot of time learning fundamentals which upped my hours/week. If you have background in this, or just want to get the projects done, you can definitely spend less time than me per week. For reference, the first mini-project took me 20+ hours while others in the forums mentioned it took them 5 hours. Also note that the class seems pretty front loaded, or at least it was for me. The tail end of the course I spent WAY less hours per week, but that could also be due to the fact that I took time in the beginning to learn fundamentals. \n\n**Grading**: The forums are fairly open for discussion and support, minus actual code sharing, which is great for learning and expanding your approaches. The head TA, Kia, was amazing. Quick responses and very helpful. They just started using a rubric for grading, so there is no ambiguity in what you will be graded on. Note that each assignment has a journal aspect. This is great if you are weak at coding as each assignment grade is only 50% code. It is not great if English is your second language/you hate writing. Overall, I found grading fair. If you put in decent effort, you can make it out of this class with an A or B.\n\n**Material**: seriously, these are the most interesting lectures I have ever watched. By far the most interesting class I have ever taken. I can not recommend this course enough. I wasn't entirely sure what the class was about when I signed up, but imagine breaking human cognition down to the most finite, subconscious elements. For example, you need to paint a ceiling and the ladder. We instantly know you must paint the ceiling first, otherwise the ladder will be wet and you can't climb it. But how do our brains make that decision? How do we break that down to a method to code into an intelligent agent? Another example: you need a cup from the kitchen, but all the cups are dirty. How do you improvise and know that bowl might be used instead? In fact, how do you even know that a yellow cup and a cup with a handle are both examples of cups? How do we learn and how do we correct mistakes in our learning? A lot of ML/AI requires thousands of data points to train on, but as humans, we often don't have that as we learn, so how do we proceed through the world with limited knowledge. Seriously, this stuff has me agreeing with Musk on simulation theory or with Sam Harris on the fact that free will is an illusion.\n\n**Prep**: If you aren't familiar with object-oriented programming, I highly recommend watching the section here on breadth-first search (https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2020/weeks/0/). The class never mentions it, and I was lucky to see it in the forum. My biggest issue with the class is not introducing this as a more concrete coding application rather than the theoretical stuff they propose. ",

                        "body": "This class' difficulty is based on how you approach the course. If you'd like to actually apply what is taught in the lectures, then the projects are a bit involved. But 4 out of the 5 mini-projects can easily be \"cheesed\" with really simple solutions, because the test cases on GradeScope are so simple. RPM is a bit involved in the beginning getting set up. As the project progresses and you have to code more, you can observe other classmate's strategies through Peer Feedback and get ideas for implementations. A lot of people complain about having to learn Pillow/OpenCV, but if you are used to reading documentation and experimenting to learn an API, it's really not that bad. \n\nThe way to make this course as easy as possible is to get high A's on all the assignments so that a low final project performance score is fine. My RPM performance scored a 55/100, but I was still easily able to get an A. \n\nTA staff is very engaged and helpful, and students are very collaborative on the forum, which is really nice. Nothing is redacted or censored. The first half of the course content is well-defined and concrete. The second half becomes a bit more nebulous, but is somewhat interesting.\n\nThe worst part of this course is really the exams. They are incredibly vague and wordy for no reason. I have no idea how a non-native speaker would be able to do well on these. Even with them being open-book, open-internet, deciphering what is being said is quite difficult. You also never get to see what was scored as correct/incorrect after grades are released, so it is a bit of a mystery what a correct answer usually looks like. The second exam was a bit more vague than the first exam.\n\nAlso, Peer Feedback requirements are excessive. This course would really benefit if they halved the required feedback amount.\n\nOverall this is the ideal first OMSCS course if you are new to CS. The programming is straightforward, the class is very well-run, TAs are awesome, and all assignments are released at the beginning of the semester with no revisions to instructions.",

They cover a wide range of topics which combine cognitive science and computer science. The videos are broken down into manageable chunks and have many helpful exercises with follow-up explanations. TAs and professor are very active on the forum and responsive. Assignments and final project draw from course lectures. There are opportunities to earn extra participation, capped at 100% for the category. No curve, no extra credit. Full course calendar is available from the beginning of class, but there isn't much room to work ahead.\n\nThe first half of the class balances between coding and written assignments, and has more cohesive content. They go over knowledge representation structures and different problem solving techniques, and keep referencing them in later lectures and incorporating them into all of the written assignments so you really get a solid foundation.\n\nThe second half of the class branches out into many different topics, and with all of the coding assignments bunched together in the middle of the term, feels a little less cohesive. You do something different every week and start to forget what you learned from previous weeks. They do reference previous material, but not as much, so it doesn't stick as well as material from the first half of the course. That being said, I still learned a lot and highly recommend this class.\n\nBackground:\n- undergrad CS background\n- work full time\n- number of previous classes: 0\n- other classes this semester: 0\n\nBreakdown of average time commitment per week:\n- 2 lessons. 1 hour to watch videos (add 1 or 2 hours for understanding the material)\n- 1 assignment, either coding + report or written homework. 20 hours\n- 3 required peer reviews. 1 hour\n- participation, easiest way to earn with confidence on number of points is with 3 extra peer reviews. 1 hour",

                        "body": "This is my first OMS course. I can safely say that this is a great course to take as an introduction to the program as a whole and is a great way to get a solid grade for your first foundational course requirement. Though, if you do not have CS experience (university or a minor) or are working full-time then this course may be more difficult.\nThe lectures are digestible and are broken up by mini quizzes that test your understanding of the material throughout. Compared to my previous institution\u2019s online lectures, these were like a Hollywood produced movies. Dr. Ashok and Dr. Joyner are great lecturers too.\n\nThere are only 2 exams in this course, both of which are open note and open book. My only critique about these is that the questions are very obtuse and require sometimes very creative applications of what is learned in the lecture.\n\n\nAside from that, most of the assignments you\u2019ll be graded on will be Homework, mini-projects, participation, and the Raven\u2019s Progressive Matrices.\n\nHomework assignments are essays that will sometimes ask you to answer a philosophical question about cognition and how said concept can be described to a computer. These assignments took the most time to complete since it was recommended to write up to 4-6 pages on these topics but they were also one of the easiest.\n\nMini-projects are the second highlight of this course. There are 5 of them all of which are based on the lectures. I would recommend not tackling these in the way the lecture explicitly tells you to tackle them. It\u2019s better to try to solve them as you would naturally, and you\u2019ll always end up solving it in a way the lecture expects you. In other words, don\u2019t think too hard about how to approach them.\n\nParticipation is based on how active you are on Ed (discussion board for asking questions and what not), giving peer review feedback on assignments, submitting example questions for exams the list goes on. If you want to max out your participation early on, I recommend doing a lot of peer review feedback. I wouldn\u2019t recommend stopping though because some peers may have some insight that can help you for Raven\u2019s Progressive Matrices.\n\nRaven\u2019s Progressive Matrices is the main highlight of this course. You\u2019re building a program that can pass a visual IQ exam. This project is broken up into 5 parts and each part tests a specific section of the IQ exam. Ultimately, if you want to do well on these assignments I recommend looking into Pillow, OpenCV, and image analysis functions like dark pixel ratios.\n\nOne more thing I forgot to add. Mini-projects and Raven's Progressive Matrices Milestones requires a report of what was accomplished and what you learned that's usually 4-6 pages long. So if you are not a fan of writing 800-1000 words a week then this course may not be for you. \nOn that note, some of the lecture topics aren't applicable for the mini-projects or Raven's Progressive Matrices even though they are advertised as so. The concepts only work when applied in an abstract way, but sometimes when programming your A.I. you may accidentally programming it the way the lectures says it should be done if you don't think about it too hard.\n\nGrades take a long time to be published with many taking 3.5 weeks or more.\n\nIn conclusion, I highly recommend this course to those first starting off in the OMS program. It gets you acclimated to discussion boards and graduate level expectations without the fear of not fulfilling the foundation course requirement of a B or higher.\n\n\n\n",

There are two homework where I spent at least 12 hours researching each. It was a subject not even related to the lectures, it was more related to ethical AI which I didn't think this class was about. I don't think the lectures actually help you solve the final project, so you ave to put it a lot of extra time to come up with a solution. I passed with an A, but I put in a lot of time. If you don't like writing a lot of papers and doing mandatory peer reviews, stay away of the class. I will say I liked the class though. I do think it was interesting but it was not what I was expecting based on the reviews here. The good side of the class is that it extremely well organized and you can start doing the assignments as soon as you want, which can put some people in advantage to work on the final project if they have the time.

The mini projects weren't all that bad overall, but some of them made me have to refresh myself on AI algorithms and the likes. For one of them though, I was able to come up with a quick 11 line solution so I'd say definitely don't overthink any of these, brute forcing is the way to go. The RPM semester-long project was definitely harder but the best things you can do are implementing basic transformations, boolean operations (OR, AND, etc), and Dark Pixel Ratio (DPR) and just taking it one milestone at a time. I was able to get around 70% accuracy with these alone. It was pretty satisfying knowing I had created an agent that could solve the majority of a set of human intelligence questions. The lectures are pretty decent, though I wish they would redo them in the style of HCI with my man Joyner taking the lead. Overall, this is definitely the better AI course in the program even if it may not be as traditional as CS 6601.",

                        "body": "This was my first OMSCS class, and I had different expectations going into the class than what I actually received from it. I almost dropped the class upon failing to implement knowledge from the lecture into mini project one, which I explain in the next paragraph. Tough it out, as I got a 97% (A) in the end. The first few weeks are overwhelming. Then somewhere in the middle, there are about 5 weeks where it gets SUPER chill. Then the last 2 weeks, it is slightly hectic, but nothing like the first few weeks. \n\nTips: \nThe first mini project was incredibly difficult because I tried to solve it by incorporating stuff from the lecture. But if you ignore the lectures and solve the mini projects using methods that are not necessarily perfect, but rather \"good enough\", you will realize that this entire course is a lot easier than it seems at first. Remember that the goal of the class is to mimic human intelligence. So sometimes, your code is allowed to reflect some of those human imperfections, too. \n\nThe same applies to RPM. But anyways, RPM was by far the most annoying part of the course, just because I had to learn computer vision with Pillow. Most checks you will implement are high-level, so Pillow is good enough to get a 100 on the project. \n\nAlso obsessing about time taken for your agents to run is not important for any of the mini projects, or RPM. For example, I know most people's RPM agents ran in under 10 seconds. Mine took 90-100 seconds but I didn't get any points docked off for my agent being slower. Only time I got points docked off was for not mentioning the time at all on a mini project, and it was only docked from the report. \n\nLast but not least, expect to write ~10 pages every week, give or take a few pages here and there depending on the assignment. You will have to not only write functioning code, but then describe it in a report/document. The homeworks are the most frustrating to write, even though you do not have to code anything. You will have to draw diagrams, independently research relevant topics, and then tie it all in with a lecture. \n\nOverall, I liked the class but was extremely frustrated with the amount of writing and doing RPM as a final project because it has a learning curve that the class workload does not account for very well. Great first class, especially for those in the Interactive Intelligence specialization, as it will be one of two required courses for them. Easy A if you are able to simply put the time into the class. Nothing was crazy hard to understand. But expect to spend as much time writing as you do coding. ",

                        "body": "**My background**: KBAI was my first OMSCS course. My undergrad was in engineering and I work in an industry that has nothing to do with using Python/Java/C++. Before KBAI, I had never used Python to code anything beyond simple addition of numbers and print \"hello world\". I fully expected to have a hard time in this course simply because I had been out of academia for so long (writing skills have tanked due to writing so many work emails) and because I had barely any useful experience using Python (hence expecting to struggle on all coding projects).\n\n**End result**: I achieved a solid A in the course, and my name showed up on the list of Exemplary works more than a handful of times. I worked hard to front-load all coding work and to finish the course as early as possible so that I could have a leisurely November and December. So the number of hours per week that I spent on the course was 20+ in the first half of the course and then dramatically dropped off in the second half of the course. I honestly didn't expect to do as well in this class as I did, so it gives me the confidence to try other courses even if I don't have the ideal prerequisite background needed to thrive from the very beginning. \n\n**Words of advice**: In this class, being able to pick up concepts quickly and apply them in various ways to coding projects is important. However, what is equally important is the ability to write reports well and to create drawings/figures/tables that enhance the quality of your reports. If you are weak in Python but a decent writer, then take the time during this course to heavily ramp up your understanding of Python and its use of structures. If you are strong in Python but not the best writer, use this time to utilize drawio or similar to draw good figures for the reports. Nothing is worse than reading just a wall of word vomit on 4 pages (each mini coding project requires a 4 page follow-up report or word vomit on 10 pages for each RPM milestone report and/or the Final RPM report).\n\nYou should also participate on Ed forum from the very beginning. Participation counts for 10% of your final grade, and there were SO MANY POSTS and feedback from students about how they struggled with getting full points on participation because they either didn't submit \"high-quality\" feedback on peer reviews for assignments or they didn't want to post on Ed forum because they had nothing to contribute/couldn't answer other people's questions quick enough, etc. People griped and whined so much about Participation grading, but honestly just have fun with the course and post your thoughts and observations. Nobody is out there judging you in the way you think people might be judging you.\n\n**Observations about the TA response rates**: For Fall of 2021, I thought the TAs were very responsive in the first half of the course. Toward the second half of the course, students would ask public questions on Ed forum and the questions would go unanswered for 1-2 weeks. This was annoying especially when the question benefits multiple students and yet the TAs would not respond. Then if someone else asks the same exact question as a new post after more than 3 weeks of the same question in a different post not having been answered, then the TAs would answer it. This happened enough times where I would get annoyed but nobody would write anything bad on Ed forum because the TAs are human beings and don't deserve vitriol from just grade-hungry students.\n\n**Observations about the students**: For Fall 2021, the unofficial Slack forum was where some students were able to collaborate on ideas and help each other get through assignments. I didn't participate very much on Slack mainly because I had front-loaded and done so much work so much faster that Slack was not helpful to me. However, Slack helped a lot of other folks (especially if deadlines were looming and folks hadn't started doing any coding work for assignments).\n\n**Summary**: If you are strong in science/engineering/math but don't have Python background or CS background, then don't be scared. You might actually be one of the best performing students in the class at the end of it all simply because of work ethics and your innate sense of ambition and curiosity to just try things out and do as well as you can in this course. \n\n",

The review below mine complaining about lack of statistical methods very clearly missed the point of this being **knowledge** based AI and not a course on ML. \n\nI came from a non-CS background and this was my first course. I expect an A. My engagement with this course fluctuated over the semester but overall I enjoyed it very much. This course has encouraged me to pursue AI further as a topic. I am coming out of this course a stronger programmer and writer. I also think slightly differently about how to approach problems with programming and could see a few applications of this course to my job.\n\nThe course is front-loaded because the first two mini-projects are the most difficult and the main project is daunting to start. I would say this course starts out hard and by the end is easy. You can finish this course early. Join the slack and read the forums when you get stuck. \n\nThose experienced in Python and good at thinking creatively would crush this course. I would also recommend it as a first course to non-CS background. My prior experience to Python was a Coursera course 1 year ago. Being good with DSA is a plus but I was able to get full performance on every mini-project with nothing more than lists and tuples. \n\nThere are 3 homeworks, 5 mini-projects, 2 exams, and the main project. The homeworks are time consuming but I learned a **lot** philosophically from the 3rd one and a good amount from the 1st one. Homework 2 was rote practice I did not like it. The first 2 mini-projects are most difficult for people without strong DSA while the last 3 are moderate-easy difficulty. MP#2 is the hardest. The exams are open notes and not hard if you watch the lectures once over. ",

Many a times it felt unnecessary writing on assignments explaining my understanding of the concepts used in KBAI systems. The  basic NLP project along with other projects were very interesting. It helped me build concepts of BFS/DFS, queue etc. First 2 projects were time consuming.

This is a Dr. Joyner class so he is very into making SURE you learn the material, via all these methods.\n\nThe professors themselves answer questions in Ed forums which is a nice change of pace to some courses. \n\nFINAL PROJECT:\n\nNote, you can get 100s on the coding portion of the RPM checkpoints if they pass 50% of the test cases. You will get a 50 on the final project coding portion if you do the same thing, and thus the final project is really the only masters level difficulty (honestly its sort of PhD level) project in the entire course, save the NLP project, which is a pain, and doesn't even teach you anything practical about implementing NLP.\n\nI believe I got <60 on the final project coding portion but comfortably got an A in the class because I got A's in everything else, but if you didn't get A's in everything else I doubt you will be able to get a good score on the final project coding portion, as doing so would require to basically implement a combination of everything you learned in the course along with decent understanding of OpenCV.\n\nEXAMS:\n\nExams are open book. That doesn't mean they are easy, honestly this is an excuse to make them extremely precise to match the exact wording of what the instructor says in the lecture. Make sure you take good and organized notes (preferably electronically, so you can search through them with keywords) and read over them at least once before the test so you know which lecture to watch again during the test for the tricky questions and you should walk out with an A (test prep. shouldn't take more than 2-4 hours assuming you already took good notes and watched the lectures and are a good test taker).

I am a big fan of Dr Joyner\u2019s courses but this one dissapointed me and stressed me enough to withdraw from it. I am surprised at all the easy reviews, may be they are experts in Python and I am at intermediate level. The course demands a lot from you - one main project with 5 milestones, 5 mini projects, 2 exams and peer reviews. If you have a demanding job that required 9+ hours of time, then you will find that the only two things in your life are job and this course as you will be switching between the two and wouldnt that time for anything else. I guess they made the syllabus of this course more harder after all the easy reviews, feedback provided by my seniors was they there were no mini projects until the recent semesters.\n\nThe guard/prisoners mini project (or fox/sheep however you want to call it) was enough to stress me out and get me out of this course. ML for trading had good videos and ideas on how to implement what is being asked but with this one you are on your own. Be preared to then write a journal once you have been drained with writing code from scratch. This, in my mind should be one of the hardest courses. Writing programs that would solve problems like humans do is no piece of cake. I generally dont write reviews or complain about courses but this one made me do it. I had never felt so down after 2 weeks into this course. I lost all my motivation, may be its just me. Having said that, I will give a shot again at this course some time later when I am mentally prepared.",

Personally, I found most of the class a bit too easy (aside from the Final RPM Project). The lectures were more philosophical and while they seemed to try to connect the lectures with the assignments, I rarely could find a practical connection (aside from the Mini-Projects, which were great). Exams are almost impossible to study for since they're written with open-book in mind and the format is essentially True/False. I'd prefer a short response exam given the course material.\n\nThe overall course material is slightly interesting, although I think they could prepare more practical lessons and less obvious approaches. I kinda feel like I wasted a class slot, although this was a summer semester so I'm not beating myself up too much. Fortunately the pace was manageable, I was actually able to take a week long vacation during the semester since all assignments are available the entire semester (until their due date).",

Homework assignments were generally straightforward.  My only complaint here is that I feel like the TAs were sometimes a little nitpicky when it came to grading them. Tests were open-book and were very challenging. My advice here is to try to watch all lecture videos and take good notes.\n\nI like the idea of participation points but I feel like the peer feedback system needs to be revamped. Most participation points are a required part of your final grade so this causes there to be a good bit of forced and inauthentic feedback/participation at times. One way I believe this could be fixed is to reduce the amount of peer feedback assignments and offer a variety of other avenues to earn participation points. Maybe fewer points could be required for mandatory participation, while other types of participation could count as optional extra credit. \n\nAnd last but not least, shoutout to Ida and Dr. Joyner!

I expect to keep going to back what I learned here in other courses.\n\nMost of the reviews of this class characterize it as \"easy\", but I didn't experience it that way. While the subject matter and coding projects aren't strenuous (particularly for someone with extensive CS experience), the workload is significant. I took the course during the Summer of 2021 and I would describe it as UNRELENTING. The normal 17 week semester was compressed into 12 weeks. No work was dropped. Each week, you're going to have at least two deliverables.  Sometimes its a coding mini project and a paper describing it (~5-6 pages). Other times its a homework essay (~5-6 pages) with a milestone for the RPM project (code submission + ~4-5 page paper). This is in addition to watching lectures (~1-2 hours) and peer feedback  (~1 hour).  If you're planning to take this during the summer and have significant plans, make sure you plan well ahead.\n\nI was involved in study group and found it to be enormously helpful when I got stuck on things.  If you're interested in something like this, post on the forums and see if you can get a group together.\n\nAs mentioned in other places, the exams are basically 110 true-false questions. Its worth taking high quality notes while you're watching them initially, even though this will take more time. Reviewing the notes and watching the lectures again at 1.6 speed was good  preparation. I'd say the re-watching is critical because some of the questions are worded in such a way that having a recent impression of the lecture will help you find what you need quickly.\n\nI was frightened by the RPM project at first, but there is actually a lot of academic writing on how to build agents that solve the matrices. Its worth doing a bit of research on your approach before getting started. I used fairly simple heuristic methods and was pleased with the results.\n\nTLDR - This is a good course that is a lot of work for the summer months because of the reduced time window.

A few things I noted over the course of the semester is that there are a lot of useless things in this class that once again make learning out of reach.  One, the exam is 110 true/false questions is open book, but very tedious and annoying for an exam setting. Two, you don't get to see what you miss on an exam, so all of the course's emphasis on learning seems pretty hypocritical. Three, on all the written assignments, there is a minimum assignment length, which makes a lot of the writing pointless and just filler writing. Furthermore, the TAs read the assignments and sometimes dock random points saying some of the questions aren't answered in detail when they are. Overall, easy A, but David Joyner's courses seem to have a decent number of complaints like the ones mentioned in this.",

                        "body": "For context, this was my 6th class in the program (CN, IHI, GIOS, CP, AI). Non-CS engineering undergrad, working as a software engineer.\n\nThis was the first summer semester with the adjusted syllabus: they added 5 nontrivial \"mini-project\" coding assignments with some reductions (shorter written Homeworks, down from 3 to 2 exams), then crammed all 17 weeks of expanded content into the 12-week summer semester. [The majority of weeks](http://lucylabs.gatech.edu/kbai/summer-2021/) had *both* a coding & writing assignment/exam due in addition to peer reviews and 2-3 lecture sets, so there's hardly a moment to breathe or get ahead. Dr. Joyner deliberately shifted the difficulty from grading to the workload, resulting in more reported hours of work but also a higher proportion of **A** grades.\n\nThe instructors made some scheduling mistakes: several assignments were due before the corresponding lectures. This piled onto the aggressive pace of the first half of the summer semester. That said, head TA Ida was probably the best TA I've ever had in OMSCS thanks to her quick and very specific help on the forums.\n\nI believe many OMSCS classes don't adjust the syllabus for the summer semester, so this class probably isn't the best or worst option for a summer semester. Strong Python students should still be comfortable in KBAI during the summer. In its current format, I would rate the class *Easy* for Fall/Spring and *Medium* for Summer.\n\n## Grading\n\nThe syllabus seems designed with the expectation that students will get lower scores on 3 assignments: the 2 exams and the final RPM code submission. These assignments are *far* more difficult to get a >90% than other assignments in the class. To get the **A**, it's important to get >95% on all the Homeworks and Mini-Projects. No curve or extra credit was offered. The Head TA stated in a forum answer that they round up for cutoffs: 89.5% rounds up to 90% for an **A**.\n\n## Homeworks (writing assignments)\n\nThe writing assignments are well-organized but simply time-consuming because the 2 main questions are subdivided into 6-10 specific sub-questions and visualizations.\n\nAchieving near full-credit on the writing assignments should be a rote exercise: follow the JDF format, use proper APA citations, answer *every* question & subquestion thoroughly, include requested visualizations. It's a good idea to always include one or two tables/figures because, unless your writing is extremely organized, the graders heavily favor visualizations. There are no points for formality, so organizing sections by questions is the most straightforward choice.\n\n## Mini-Projects (coding assignments)\n\nI appreciate the intent to create interesting, open-ended applications of the course content. As other reviews noted, it's easy to find overspecialized solutions which exploit the predictability of the autograder, which is more lenient than other OMSCS courses. These are all 50% autograder (Gradescope), 50% written report. For better or worse, 3 of these problems are graph problems, so CS6601: AI students have a huge advantage here.\n\n1. **Missionaries & Cannibals**: other reviews have cried \"it's just BFS!\" but that is exactly the point: state-space searching is a large component of AI. The whole challenge is creating & managing the state representation.\n1. **Blocks World (Sussman anomaly)**: I believe this is the most challenging mini-project. It's similar to the first project but uninformed search will not work. My solution was a *hill-climbing* algorithm from YouTube.\n1. **Sentence Reading**: I agree with other reviews - this *would* be the most difficult problem if it wasn't so easy to exploit the grading methodology with hardcoded workarounds. I didn't see anything more creative from peers in the class because we can't use any NLP tools. Most students created a *production system* (series of `if-else` statements) which mapped question words (e.g. who, when) to the set of possible answers. I also abused the grader a little and submitted 20 times until I got a favorable set of questions for full credit.\n1. **Monster Identification (Classification)**: I thought the problem might require a *nearest-neighbor* or *version spaces* approach, but my first straightforward attempt scored 100% with just 8 lines of Python code. This is definitely the easiest programming assignment I've completed in OMSCS.\n1. **Monster Diagnosis**: Yep, another state-space search problem (I used *A**, but BFS should work). The data is nested dictionaries of strings, so a bit more annoying to work with than MP1. I saw a lot of peers brute-force this problem with `itertools`.\n\n## Raven's Progressive Matrices\n\nThis semester-long project is the most interesting challenge of the class.\n\nFor students who have a hard time coming up with solving strategies: start with the [Joyner paper](http://www.davidjoyner.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/JoynerBedwellGrahamLemmonMartinezGoel-ICCC2015-Distribution.pdf) and take advantage of Peer Reviews & Exemplary Reports for more ideas.\n\nI didn't get penalized for literally hardcoding the answers to the Basic problems with a simple lookup table, so that was a guaranteed 50% minimum on the coding portion. As long as the report demonstrates that you put effort into more generalized strategies, you'll get a solid grade. Ideally, you aced all the Homeworks, Mini-Projects & Milestones so you don't need a high score here.\n\n## Exams\n\nProctored but with generous policies: open-note, open-book, open-internet. As another review mentioned, the exam is effectively 110 True/False questions. The instructors also put in effort to ensure none of the answers derive verbatim from the lecture notes, so a substantial amount of reading comprehension is required similar to the SAT or GRE exams. I sympathize with the non-native English speakers in the class because I honestly believe they're disadvantaged.\n\n*In my opinion*, the only effective strategy is recognizing the lectures associated with questions. The exams will punish you for rushing or skimming through the lectures. I rewatched all the lectures on 1.7x or 2x speed the week before the test to \"study\" and achieved one of the top few scores on each exam. The class provides a PDF with all the lecture transcripts to make this a bit faster to review. Thankfully, the exam does not pull any content from research papers or additional readings.",

KBAI is a subset of AI.\n* **Written Assignment**: There are 3 Written assignments. It's loosely related to the lecture. \n* **Mini Projects**: 5 Mini projects + Report. Not difficult. Most of them are just a bunch of if/else statements. You don't actually need to code AI agent to solve them, just a bunch of IF/Else as the GradeScope grader is dumb.\n* **RPM Projects**: Students without OpenCV or Pillow experience are going to struggle. A lot of students complain about the difficulty of final delivery. I don't understand why didn't they read the requirement. Everything was posted in the beginning of the class. Some students are like oh I didn't expect my implementation of DPR/IPR can't solve the problem set D and E. It's a semester long project. You should have read the requirement before you implement your agent. This project is fun and I got 94/100 for the final delivery. You absolutely need to invest your time in it if you want a high score. However, you can hardcode the solution and easily get up to a decent score as long as your writing skills are good. You need to score 100% on all the reports as it counts 50% of each delivery.\n* **Exams**: 2 Open Everything exams. No point to study. One can easily search the notes you prepare and find the answer. \n* **Participation**: You need to be active on Ed and do all the peer review to get this 10 points. Not difficult, just tedious to read through boring papers from your classmates.\n* **Professor**: Professor Joyner is great. Very active in Ed and communicate with students every week. \n* **TA**: Best TA in the program. No nonsense Rubric deduction. Grading is very clear and generous.  Grades are returned in a couple weeks and I rarely see anyone complain about grades on Ed. No drama like other courses.\n* **Difficulty**: RPM is not difficult, You just need to put in your effort. One can easily get a decent score with hardcoding or overfitting the solution. Mini projects are not difficult. Some projects can be done with a couple hours. \n* **Time Management**: Don't follow the schedule. Work 2 weeks ahead of the schedule and you would be very comfortable in this class. This class requires 10-15 hours/week and the second half is more relaxing when you get your RPM mostly done in the first half. If you follow the schedule and only implemented DPR for B and C, you would probably be stressed in the last 2 weeks.",

                        "body": "This was my first course in the OMSCS program and have little to compare it to. I have taken undergrad AI courses previously. For reference, I got a comfortable A. \n\nFrom my understanding, this course was majorly updated this semester, with the inclusion of 5 mini-coding projects, and less writing-based homeworks. The final RPM project now allows unlimited Gradescope submissions, but full credit requires answering every basic and test problem given. I didn't hear of anyone who received full credit on it. Most people (from anecdata) seemed to get around 70%. However, your grade is very evenly spread out among the assignments from the rest of the course, it was a non-issue. RPM problems are now visual-only as well. There is a deliverable every week, and yes, usually writing is necessary. I am comfortable with writing, however, and found that to be pretty easy. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n - Prof. Joyner appears to be genuinely very enthusiastic and caring about the quality of the course. Processes have been tweaked nearly to perfection, there were no road bumps along the way \n - The coding aspects of the assignment are enjoyable, dare I say, fun! \n - Grades among course work are very balanced. Nothing is weighted too heavily. As long as you keep up, you will easily pass\n - All assignments are released at the start of the course. You can front load the crap out of this course, which is what I did. It was very useful because I knew I would get very busy in March, so I completed about 75% of the course before then (note that I did take a week off between jobs during this time to get ahead).\n - High level topics are interesting to think about\n - The workload seemed extremely manageable to complete on top of a full time job and still have time for personal activities. For reference, I work full time, changed jobs (to a higher-responsibility job), bought and moved into a house, produced and ran a virtual film festival, and worked a side gig 4 nights a week for a month during this semester (no kids though, haha). \n - There is a lot of flexibility allowed for how you solve coding problems. \n - Low stress, open note exams.\n\n**Downsides**\n\n - As mentioned, coding allows for flexible solutions. You can use course concepts...or not. As another reviewer mentioned, this can mean that some of the projects are pretty trivial to solve and not actually useful in extending your knowledge about the course concepts. Several of the mini-projects felt like interview practice questions for me. Fun to code out, but not useful to me in building my knowledge deeper \n - The amount of peer feedback you have to give is a bit of a drag\n - Lecture videos also kind of drag toward the end of the course \n - Grading, while generous, felt a bit nitpick-y at times. Most of the points I got deducted were for \"not explaining enough\" when \"enough\" was never defined in the first place.  \n - I am not a fan of the exam format. There are two exams of essentially 110 true/false questions. You need only study for a few hours for these, and are low-stress, but your full results are never released, so I don't feel like they reinforced any knowledge, personally. It felt like they were included in the curriculum out of obligation. \n - A lot of the RPM project was solving image processing/computer vision problems, which is not content covered whatsoever in the course. Prepare to dig into openCV documentation A LOT before you can even begin to think about solving the problems with the concepts discussed in the lecture videos. This is the crux of what people mean, I believe, when they say the project is not related to the course very well. \n\n**Overall impression**\n\nKBAI is a solid, fair course. It is well run and well organized. The expectations and workload are very manageable. Difficulty leans a little toward the easier side. However, I don't feel it gave a lot back to me or deepened my knowledge in great ways. This is partially in part my own fault for not challenging myself further with the projects. You get what you put into this course. Because of this flexibility, it is a little easy to shrug off some of the work. ",

The new mini-projects were nice in that they allowed us to put the lecture concepts into practice, but they were often very trivial and could be completed without any concepts from KBAI.  The RPM project, on the other hand, felt like a drag because it felt completely unrelated to the rest of the course. The peer feedback system also felt like a chore simply due to the sheer amount of feedback we are required to give to get participation points. \n\nOverall, this is an easy course with a moderate workload, but I don't think I learned much at the end of it all.\n\n\nAlso, there is a TON of writing in this course, so if that is not your cup of tea, beware.",

The class is very well-organized, and although I found it slightly front-loaded, the amount of work I spent on the course each week was roughly the same.\n\nMy best advice for this course would be for the RPM project--the course's semester-long project.  Although I enjoyed the project a lot, I think it's fair to say that the concepts from the lectures of the course are really only loosely tied to the project.  For me, the project was much more about learning about image processing and researching strategies.\n\nBack to the advice: there are helpful milestones for completing this project (generally, one milestone per problem set type); however, I made the mistake of trying to always generalize the code of my previous milestones to fit new milestones.  This was a mistake.  Instead, you should create modules per milestone which the agent can call depending on the problem set name.  For each milestone, you should then try as hard as you can to fit your algorithm specifically to that problem set.  If you do this along the way, the final project will be essentially complete through the milestones.",

I see where people are coming from, but I think it depends on how you choose to look at the problems. Personally for me, I tried looking for patterns on my own first before looking at any papers and felt that the lectures did help frame my thought process (even though I don\u2019t think I can attribute anything I used directly to the lectures except maybe generate and test). And even though I did not end up using DPR/IPR, some of the discussions around it did help me improve my agent too. \n\nI believe how much you will enjoy this class will depend on how much you want to put into it.

                        "body": "I thoroughly enjoyed this class. It was overwhelming at first as there is something due every week, but it is one of the most organized classes I've taken. The full calendar breaks down not only what lectures and projects to complete, but when you should start working on projects that will take more than a week to complete.\n\nI have a strong background in Python, a CS degree, and was familiar with numpy through CP. Most of the coding took me a couple days at most to get a full credit solution. The exceptions were MP 3 and the final RPM.  I was one of the ones who attempted a frame based solution (and only partially succeeded) for MP3 when this version could be solved with a series of if statements (I believe they plan to change this in the future). \n\nRPM is the ongoing project. The milestones aren't too difficult. I was able to pass one or two with horrible solutions that did just enough, but had to go back and redo a lot for the final version. I wish they'd move all the milestones to the end so you don't have to constantly switch between RPM and the other assignments.\n\nThe reports are tedious to write but the number of times I'd start explaining my agent and realize a detail that could improve it made me feel like it was worth it. Make sure you follow the format. Use the template - it makes life easier and means you loose less points.\n\nParticipation is frustrating to get. Opportunities for participation other than forum posts and peer feedback are rare. If you're not the type to post often on the official forum, automatically do the 3 required and the 5 extra peer feedbacks as you go. Otherwise you'll be giving feedback for assignments due 3 months ago. Peer feedback as a tool to improve my future reports is almost worthless. Occasionally I'd get some valuable notes, but most of the time it's \"looks great/good\" or everything is wrong because I didn't do something exactly like the reviewer did. As a tool to understand other ways to complete the projects, it's invaluable. For RPM, some of the changes I made came from reviewing somebody's report for feedback. The exemplary reports are also a great resource for this.",

A lot has been said about the high quality of the lectures, the divisiveness of the RPM project, the general ease of the exams, etc, so I won't delve into that.\n\nThere's not a lot of info here about the mini-projects though, so here are my thoughts on them:\n\n**MP1** is very simple, all you have to do is apply a simple idea from the lectures and implement BFS or A* and you're fine.  \n**MP2** is perhaps the most open-ended one; I saw many approaches to it. It's not crazy difficult per se, but it's a little deceptive. It looks about the same difficulty as MP1, but took me twice as long.  \n**MP3** probably looks like the most interesting one from afar, and it's pretty cool, although definitely the most time consuming. Prepare to likely spend a while pre-processing the words. A lot of students started out trying to use a Frames-related approach, and switched to heuristics or a production system later. This semester, a lot of students got full points by implementing a very hacky solution since there were only 60, maybe 80 test cases. I don't know if that'll be the case in future semesters.  \n**MP4** was shockingly easy. My full file, including starter code, was less than 25 lines. YMMV, and once again I wonder if future semesters will have more rigorous test cases.  \n**MP5** was also pretty easy. Like in MP1, BFS or A* are your friend if you can mix them with a generate and test ideology.\n\nThe other big changes of note this semester are that the RPM was graded more leniently for the milestones, but more strictly for the final project, the homework essays have been shortened, and the exams have been condensed into two tests instead of three. Things did seem very confused when it came to grading; almost every grade for the first two months was entered incorrectly on Canvas, only to be changed to the correct score a few hours later. This led to a lot of freaking out on the class forum, but generally smoothed itself out as the semester went on. I imagine it will be less of a problem in future semesters.\n\nMy hour count is a complete guess, as I finished over half of the course's content in the first month or so by working ahead.\n\nLike I said, I came from a non-compsci background, and yet managed to do very well on each RPM milestone, exam 1, homework, and got full marks on each miniproject. I'm waiting on my final grades, but I'd be surprised if I didn't end up with an A. I'd highly recommend this course to anyone who is either new to the program or wants a course with interesting content, relatively easy coding assignments, and a fair amount of writing."

They are concise and relatively clear. They cover a broad range of topics and do drill into enough detail to get a solid idea of the principles. \n\n**Exams**\nThese aren't difficult to pass but hard to ace. If you've paid attention and written some notes about the lectures you should be fine. \n\n**Homeworks** \nThese are just essays. You are expected to look up a topic and write a few pages about it. They're not bad but they're also not as engaging as some of the other assignments in this course. To me they felt a bit shallow and really should have been more of a discussion of sorts instead of a written paper. \n\n**Mini Projects**\nThese are, hands down, the best assignments in the course. These are setup to give you the opportunity to actually practice the lessons learned in the lectures. They are modeled or sometimes complete copies from the lectures. These have been a lot of fun and the most engaging. I WISH the final project was more like these, or just a bigger version of one of these. \n\n**RPM project**\nThis is going to be your bane of existence in this class. This is the final project and it's absolute garbage. As others have pointed out, this is really the professor's attempt to crowd source solutions to the RPM problems and see what novel solutions student's can come up with. The problem is that there isn't enough time dedicated to try any novel approach. There is just enough time to get the easiest solution working, so everyone ends up finding the paper about IPR/DPR and implementing that. Even if you wanted to try something else since you're allowed to use Pillows and OpenCV, the course then shifts from AI to more image processing. Some image course really should either be a prereq or the students should be given some tools/wrappers for those libraries to allow them to focus on the AI aspects instead of wasting all their time with just the image processing aspect. \n\n**Summary**\nThe course might be better for some, but I enrolled in an AI course and with how much of the grade is dependent on the final project it feels more like an image processing class. The experience has honestly been the 2nd worse of my OMS career and I can't recommend this class in good faith unless you have already taken an image processing class or are prepared to find previous RPM papers and copy their efforts.

                        "body": "Great course overall which I am really enjoying, however there are some flaws which (depending on what you want to get out of this course) may be annoying.\n\nLectures are great - they are clear, concise and present the topics well.\n\nExams are tricky - you are effectively assigning true/false to over 100 statements. The floor is high for this (as you should get ~50% just by guessing) however it is trickier to get a 90%+. This is just exam 1, have yet to take exam 2 though I understand the format is the same.\n\nHomeworks - there are 3 of these, which are written papers of between 4-6 pages. They are good as well as thought provoking. Also (If you have not taken a Joyner class before) the format the class insists on has a lot of spacing and margins. So 4 pages of text here is not as much as your typical 4 pages in a newly opened word doc for example.\n\nMini Projects - there are 5 of these and they are fun, they do get you thinking. My only complaint is that on a some of them it is easier (and arguably more effective) to come up with your own solution rather than using concepts from the lectures.\n\nRPM project - this is semester long and in total is worth 30% of your grade. You have 4 milestones throughout the semester (these are worth a combined 15% and each has a paper associated with it) and then the final submission (worth 15% and includes a paper you must write). I've enjoyed this a lot, but again it is easier to complete focusing on image processing/openCV than it is using many of the concepts from the lectures. My python/openCV knowledge has come a long way, but my ability to implement KBAI concepts, less so.\n\nIn summary this is a great course - though be warned that to get the most of the course you need to be disciplined when completing the projects. You can go through most of the project work without using any concepts from the lectures - if you want to get the most out of this I recommend at least trying (even though it will take longer and may affect your grade).\n\nAlso if you hate writing and having to submit something most weeks - this might not be a good course for you. Though you can work ahead a fair bit also so that helps if you are able to get ahead.\n"

I have been out of both the technical and academic fields now for 15 years so I thought this would be a good course to help me transition back into things.  For the most part, I was right.  The course was excellent in many aspects, good in some and bad in some.  It was superbly organized and managed.  Expectations, objectives, and communication were all clear, concise and seemed ready-made for the student's needs.  The material for the most part was super-interesting from a cognitive/philosophical standpoint.  Both of which hit spot on to many of my interests.  \n\nThe homework assignments were hit or miss.  Some of them were very interesting and provided excellent opportunities for both learning the subject matter as well as expanding on our own thoughts and arguing for our viewpoints.  Other homework assignments were needlessly repetitive and outright boring (reading multiple papers and summarizing, etc).\n\nThe Raven's Progressive Matrix project is the main focal point and stretched through the entire semester.  I put in a massive amount of hours on the first iteration but after that the effort vs. return seemed to diminish greatly as only minor changes were needed to achieve acceptable performance.\n\nThe reports for each iteration got extremely repetitive given the required format of reflecting on the same points for each of up to 10 submittals per project.  I think this format could be tweaked to achieve the instructor's goals of encouraging iterative improvement while at the same time limiting the repetition of trying to figure out how to say the same things in eighty different ways.\n\nThe exams were not difficult but did require a good amount of familiarity with the material and/or very organized and efficient keyword searching during the exams (which are open-everything).\n\nThe thing I found most enjoyable about this course was its cross-disciplinary exposure to topics in psychology, philosophy and neuroscience.  These topics forced me to really sit and think through my stance on the nature of consciousness, self, and personhood.  Overall I enjoyed this course and found it manageable from a difficulty/time spent perspective.",

First of all, they are quite repetitive. Secondly, most students (myself included) ended up with overfitted pixel-based approaches that can crack the problems without using anything related to \"knowledge based\" methods taught in the class. At the end of the day, I feel the RPM projects only improved my report-writing skills, not much on programming or KBAI knowledge.\n\nI am glad to know that the instructors planned to dramatically change the agenda of the course going forward, by including more lecture-relevant programming exercises and reducing the weight of the RPM projects. Hopefully, all these changes will make the class more coherent and enjoyable for future students. \n\n",

Liked the content, though it was high level and language agnostic. I must have landed at the cusp of an A (sub 90, got an A).\n\n## Assignments\nHomeworks were thought provoking and took me about 10-15 hours each. I think they gave me a good overview of ethical issues in the field of AI. I imagine the time commitment for the papers will go down as new projects are being introduced. Expect the focus to become literature review, ethics and philosophy of AI.\n\nThe new projects are going to focus around concepts taught in class and of the couple I did, were quite fun. Looks like these will be code X and submit. Though there could be a small write-up.\n\n## RPM\nThis project will still exist in some form (at least that was the most recent decision). Was fun solving a somewhat \"real\" problem. My first agent was verbal which felt in-sync with the course. The latter two agents were visual and felt more disconnected. In future semesters, students will probably be focusing on the visual techniques.\n\n## Exams\nI did ok on these. Questions are based on lectures and the exam is essentially a True/False format. It is valuable to familiar with the lecture material before taking the exam."

The RPM project was fun and challenging enough, without being too stressful.\n\n#### Assignments\n3 homeworks, about 8 pages each.  The JDF format isn't terrible to work with as they provide starter documents in Google Docs and Word.  Half of the questions are interesting and immediately relevant to material, the other half are philosophical/ethics-based questions which are a little painful if you don't like writing.\n\n#### Projects\nProjects are great - progression of difficulty is a little steep from 2->3 given the types of patterns you have to find and a lot of trial and error is required depending on your technique.  I found making some sort of automated tests helped catch regressions.  I ended up making a spreadsheet with answers and conditional highlighting so I could quickly find accuracy % and catch any regressions on previously correct answers.  I did verbal for P1, then visual for P2, P3 which worked out.\n\n#### Exams\nThe exams are nothing to stress about.  Just watch all lecture content on 2x speed beforehand, have the PDF version of the lectures available, and CTRL+F any questions you don't immediately know and it'll work out.\n\n#### Peer Reviews\nThis was the most painful part of the course for me.  You get 'assigned' 5 peer reviews per HW/Project paper, which comes out to 30 'assigned' peer reviews.  Each one of these is 8-14 pages each, which is a LOT to read and sometimes very painful to get through.  Then you have to provide a review that meets a 'quality' criteria.  The grade for this is your participation grade, so you don't necessarily have to do it, but it depends on what other options exist for participation credit.  Thankfully, we had 5 mini-projects this semester that would count for more than enough to get full participation credit so I was able to stop the peer reviews.\n\n#### New Course Content in future semesters\nWe had 5 optional participation credit mini-projects available that are supposed to be normal assignments in future semesters.  I've read a lot of hype around the 'NLP' assignment here, but it is very basic in nature and doesn't involve serious NLP concepts, but is instead an exercise in framing.   The other projects were very relevant to course material and I think will improve the experience overall.  They were some fun programming/algorithm challenges that give you an opportunity to solve problems closely related to lectures and go through the process that is generally hand-waved during lectures.  The RPM project is likely going to change in that it might just be 1 big semester-long project, but I'm not 100% what the plan is.  Overall, I would expect the quality of the course to be higher in future semesters with these changes.\n\nOverall, fun class, not too hard, not too easy, great way to refresh Python and learn some high-level AI concepts.  Was a nice starter class because some weeks you can get away with doing nothing and it's possible to cram work before assignments are due without sacrificing your sanity.\n",

There are certain questions which make you read about various papers published in AI or general GDPR rules and write your theses. The projects have not changed over the years but it gives you that first hand experience of designing something in AI if you are new to AI or Python.

However, as you approach the final weeks, you start to see where the David is trying to get at. He is creating cognition not in machines but the students.

Think of how you would approach a google interview, this course give you a good insight of how to do it, provided you are able to relate what is taught to yourself. \n\nOverall, projects are doable if you relate to the lectures, which i admit they are mostly dis-linked.

Also, go to pinned slack messages from previous semesters and see what algorithms other people programmed to solve the RPM IQ tests.\n\nOverall, I felt my programming skills were refined and I got a decent understanding of AI outside of the realm of ML.

Some even said they can complete the whole course and all assignments (3 homework, 3 projects, 3 exams, 25 lectures) within two weeks. I think those reviews are simply not true, except if those reviewers are superman (or maybe they really are?).\n\nI think I did learn something from this course. At least I learned that AI is different from Machine Learning (ML) that AI learns from very small sample size and behaves much more like human than ML. And in contrary to ML, AI can apply to a wider range of problems, while an ML algorithm will typically fit a specific problem.\n\nThere are some areas in this course that may make students think they learn nothing from it, including some concepts which common developers may already be very familiar (e.g. configuration, script, pre / post conditions, frames (i.e. classes)). The course did introduce these concepts, even with very detailed examples, but some experienced software developers may think those concepts are nothing new. Students may even complete all three projects without even knowing a single skill taught by the course...\n\nNevertheless, I think those AI algorithms can really help, even in doing the final project, if you have the time and patience to integrate those algorithms into a single working Java / Python application.\n\nThe homeworks are almost all writing tasks, and some questions are philosophical rather than computational. Some questions even touch religious topic such as \"what is free will?\" or \"what is consciousness?\", which I am comfortable with, but I understand some students may consider those questions as totally irrelevant....\n\nOne thing I do not really understand is why the course designer insists on using visual methods to do the final project. That makes the visual recognition, instead of the artificial intelligence, becomes the greatest hurdle of the project. My question is, are we not having the right to do intelligence, if we do not have the vision ability? Anyway, I chose the fractal method, which the instructor introduced at an very early stage, though from all the peer feedbacks I cannot see anyone doing the same fractal method, which is a shame since I made a very slow fractal algorithm, and I do want to see some other students doing the fractal method but with a faster speed.\n\nSo, to all future students who want to do the fractal method with Python, beware of a very low speed. I saw many other students do the ASTI or something like the different pixel count, and they can achieve very good result with a much faster speed. Fractal method is very versatile, but may not be suitable for this project, except if you can implement it very efficiently (perhaps with Java?).\n\nFinally, I think this course is fine. And professor Joyner is very responsive. I think you will not regret taking this course.",

The course introduces you to AI in general and focuses Knowledge-based AI.\n\nVideo lectures\n\nThe video lectures were well done. The topics were explained to be understood even by non-CS students and the exercises were mainly fun and could help understand the topics in these lectures. They are also broken down to 2-5 minutes so you don\u2019t feel overwhelmed. Each module can take you between 45-90 minutes if you are doing all the exercises and taking notes. In some parts you may speed up the video to finish faster.\n\nThe big issue with the lecture content is, some of them are outdated and not used in the real-world. For example, detecting 3D objects by detecting edges is not used today and instead deep learning is the prominent method for visualization. Cannot say for NLP because I am not as knowledgeable enough.\n\nAssignments\n\nThe three assignments were mainly essays of 10 pages, each with four questions. The questions can be either exercises to do based on the video lectures, others ask to read about GDPR and Toronto Declaration, and the rest are \u201cethical\u201d questions open to argument. As usual, Dr. Joyner\u2019s assignments are a lot of writing so while the question is not difficult, the time needs to express and write in summarized and concise fashion can be challenging, not mentioning that writing essays can be tedious especially on weekends or after long hours of work if you have a job.\n\nMy main problem with the assignments is, Dr. Joyner wants to make sure you are \u201cbusy\u201d with them rather than the core value and goal of them. For example, third assignment asks you to read, summarize, find the major contributions and possible weaknesses for FOUR papers. Not one, not two, but four. If you know that the papers are heavily AI-related, it can be challenging to find a paper which a novice student can understand and summarize, let alone find the possible weakness or suggested future work. I am not new to such assignments as I enrolled in Dr. Joyner\u2019s HCI course which is similar, yet far more assignments. So for me KBAI assignments were a breeze in comparison.\n\nProject\n\nYou have to work on a project, submitted in three parts, aims to solve Raven\u2019s progressive matrices problems. The concept is neat and I was interested in building an AI agent to be able to solve such problems. Until I started working and found out I ended up \u201ccoding\u201d to make my agent work without caring about using KBAI methods presented in the lectures because: 1) There is not enough time. 2) The goal is to solve as many problems than how you solve them and 3) The project has NOTHING to do with the lectures. This is frustrating because you feel you are not learning how to do develop and agent using AI methods you are supposedly learning. The other big problem is you are required to use out-of-date libraries in order for your project submission to work online (Bonnie). This is troubling knowing that such versions are not easy to install and students should not suffer with old Python and library versions.\n\nYou are also required to write a journal to explain your project\u2019s goal, progress and future improvements. The journal is important to grading your project so it can add to the stress, and yes, it will take 8-12 pages so keep this in mind.\n\nExams\n\nYou have three exams, each after assignment and project submission. The exams ask about the topics discussed in the lectures. They are multiple-choice questions with true/false statements. If you took a course for Dr. Joyner before, you will be used to the exam\u2019s format. The exam is open book so you can open your own notes, revise the lectures and even google for answers.\n\nParticipation and Feedback\n\nSame as all Dr. Joyner\u2019s courses, you need particiaption points by giving feedback to students\u2019 homework and project journals and participating in Piazza (ugh). This can be very cumbersome when you realize you need to do that after the lectures, assignments and projects so you\u2019ll be exhausted because you don\u2019t have time to take a break. It also feels very forced to enter a badly-designed forum and \u201cparticipate.\u201d The feedback can be interesting to know how other students solved some questions and tackled the challenges faced buiding their AI agents and you can get a lot of good ideas. But also reviewing students\u2019 homework and reading the same answers can be really boring. In the end, TAs are paid to do that!\n\nOverall, as all Dr. Joyner\u2019s courses, KBAI is well-organized. The lectures are clear and easy to follow. The assignments are a lot of work and you will be very busy during the course.",

Makes me wonder how I will be evaluated. Questions could be more straight to the point. \n* Some of the homework questions and page count restrictions do not make sense. (Only option was attaching diagrams with reduced font size)\n* There is Revise & Reflection points which means you not only have to get your projects working but also need to make multiple submissions over a couple of days.It pains me to think how they have included this as It is not always possible for someone to spend a couple of days in a row for a project. I don't know about others, but if I get 2 full hours on a weekday, that's perfect time management.\n* Very unclear participation points that I stopped worrying about it multiple updates on participation points in Canvas. (Its a moving train!)\n* 'Substantial' Peer Feedback for 4 people is a lot of work.  Each submission has atleast 10 pages. So you would peer feedback for atleast 40 pages every week.\n* Usage of outdated libraries is limiting. The only reason for usage of outdated libraries was that \"Boonie\" could not be updated.\n* Verbal approach and visual approach for projects are vastly different. Recommend to start in visual approach! However there is no relation to the course material as visual approach is heuristic based.\n* Reading the paper on \"using Human computation to acquire Novel methods\" felt like a back stab; Is that why we are required to submit over 5 days for Revise & Reflect points. Are our project submissions being used for research for Novel methods? Are we unknowingly part of an experiment? Of Course the 4 people have been credited, but what about the other 220 people; Were they aware their projects was used for a study?\n\nBottom line: Easy & well organized course material, but the process to earn your credit points is at times extremely difficult & poorly organized.",

                        "body": "KBAI is a classic Prof. Joyner class - if you liked HCI, then you'll like KBAI. It's also probably a pretty decent introduction to the OMSCS program as well since it has a nice mix of coding, writing, test taking, peer reviewing, etc. with good video lectures worth watching and a free ebook to study from. Overall, KBAI is a very high quality class with both active TA's and an active professor on Piazza.\n\nThat being said, for many classmates, the writing assignments (3 in total) and participation grades (80 points in total) were a bit of a struggle, but if you start early and post on Piazza frequently, then they should not be a problem. Some of the writing assignments can get a bit abstract though, discussing the ethical considerations of AI and the ideas of \"free will\" for example.\n\nThe coding projects were mostly done using Python's standard libraries with NumPy and Pillow (important to note that OpenCV was not allowed for image manipulation) to make an AI agent solve visual puzzles for a grade. In total, there were 3 separate projects for development with increasing complexity and difficulty, and each also required a written journal response detailing the development processes and results. The top 10 individuals with the best performing agents after each project received an additional 5% to their final grade (equivalent to a single exam), so my recommendation would be to try to get that in Project 1, which is the easiest, by scoring perfect results (12 out of 12) on the Basic and Test problem sets at a minimum.\n\nThe 3 exams themselves were difficult, but not unfair. Each are 1 hour long with 15 multiple choice questions, where multiple answers are correct. The questions can get very technical to really test your understanding of the material. And while the exams are all open notes, videos, and Internet (just no taking it with another person), Googling the questions will not help at all. Instead, my strategy was to watch the lecture videos, which are much better than most of the other OMSCS class videos anyway, and then use the ebook for quick ctrl+F referencing during the exams.\n\nOverall, the class is difficult and can take a decent amount of effort / workload depending on how comfortable you are with writing papers and coding using Python (+ NumPy and Pillow). I took Computer Vision in a previous semester and that helped out a lot, despite not being allowed to use OpenCV. Ultimately though, there is no curve for the class, so to get an A, you need at least a 90%, B you need at least an 80%, etc. However, I was able to comfortably secure an A without too much trouble by closely following the syllabus and assignment due dates. The class is structured for students to do well with enough time in between assignments for very good pacing.\n\n ",

                        "body": "This class focuses on AI and its relation to human cognition, in both directions: thinking about our own reasoning to build AI agents that can learn with minimal data, and comparing AI techniques to understand more about human cognition. This is the \"knowledge-based\" aspect that many reviewers regard as antiquated. In a sense, I agree. But I still found the topics interesting, and I don't regret taking this class. \n\nI don't have many complaints, but I do wish this class didn't involve so much writing. I ended up writing 53 pages in total (3 homework, 3 projects). That's not too bad, since some of that space is taken up by figures and tables, and the margins are quite wide. But it was still a lot of writing. My biggest complaint is probably that most of the course material is not required for the projects, and while the topics are interesting, it's hard to apply them to code without a little bit of guidance. It's entirely possible to complete the projects without using any concepts from the lessons. The exams are multiple choice and have some tricky wording at times, but are fair. It's worth noting that I'm a native English speaker and I had no trouble understanding the lecturer. \n\nOverall, I enjoyed this class, and I have more positive feelings toward it than negative. The content was interesting to me, despite not being immediately applicable to the projects. I especially liked version spaces and incremental concept learning. The structure of the class was nice and predictable: watch lessons, do homework, do a project, take an exam. Repeat 3x. The class can be completely front-loaded, everything is available right away including the exams. Start with the visual approach for the projects and take a look at the papers you're given to get some ideas. Dr. Joyner was very involved in the course and checked in on Piazza regularly, and offered plenty of opportunities for flexibility due to COVID. If you're looking for a summer class just to get some credits knocked out, I'd recommend Software Analysis & Test over KBAI. It's about equally applicable but overall an easier course, in my opinion. But if you're looking for a course to round out your AI experience, KBAI is worthwhile.",

It was amazing to see the level of empathy he has for the students. We all know how awesome of an instructor he is already, and it was very nice to see his level of understanding, sincerity, and patience in dealing with students who are going through an unprecedented time.\n\nNow regarding the practical knowledge of the class itself, I am not sure how to relate it to future classes or at work. Learning Pillow APIs, Image Manipulation, etc were good to learn, however, OpenCV has far more applicability than Pillow in my opinion. I also felt the knowledge is too abstract. From a coding perspective, I found it to be pretty easy. \n\nThe RPM project was the brightest part. The exams were the least likable part. The exam questions were like parsing grammar and words. Amount of writing in this class is intense. I wrote a total of 65 pages in JDF format for this class. However, I can write quickly so for many of the homework I was able to knock them out over a weekend.\n\nThis class has a lot of potential to be far better if it could be re-tweaked to have more coding assignments, add an NLP project, and getting rid of the exams.\n\nTips:\n\n1. Start with visual approach from P1. Developing a good set of visual heuristics in P1 can help make rest of the project deliverables fairly straightforward with parameter tuning for each problem sets.\n2. Learn Affine transformations (from the research paper), DPR, IPR, logical operations (OR, AND, XOR, INVERTED XOR), and connected components labelling. These should be good enough to pass all the tests in the projects.\n3. Use numpy for everything. \n4. Use overleaf to make JDF super easy to use. Also use lucidcharts or draw.io for diagrams/charts.\n5. Also make sure that you have at least 6+ submissions for each project to get continuous improvement grades in the projects.",

I am not a python expert and easing into coding again and given all the projects even if there was a boiler plate, I had no clue on what to do and was walking like a headless chicken. Dr. Joyner helped out on where to find video tutorials and I was able to finally reach out with a TA. Most TAs are not the most responsive, I guess I was too lucky to find one. Classmates were very helpful as well. I have learned a few python here.\n\nI think it would have been better if I have prepared myself before taking this course or maybe I should have taken a course where it piques my interest. I guess I wasn't really interested in Knowledge Based AI. Maybe courses that may help introduce python and explain codes line by line. Overall it is a good class.

The lectures were of good quality and were all you really needed for the tests. I found I could watch them once or twice and then listen to them in the car a few times in order to study for tests. The projects were challenging enough (for me, anyway, as a relative newbie to Python) and taught me a lot.  Like it or not, one thing you learn is why it's incredibly difficult to replicate human intelligence with traditional programming and AI methods, so that's why ML is \"winning\". But still, I think it's useful to understand KBAI, even if ML is the present and future of AI. Joyner also uses other techniques to try to increase contact between classmates.  So you get points for insightful Piazza comments, and for reviewing your classmates' assignments and providing non-trivial feedback to them. I know some people find this annoying but it's useful to see some other peoples' work and learn about how you could improve your approach. ",

                        "body": "I took this my first semester alongside HCI and it was definitely my favorite of the two! \n\n***Course Material (3 tests)***\nThe lectures are really interesting and have examples and quizzes throughout to keep your attention. The tests are open note/book/internet and only worth 5% of your grade each so they're pretty low stress. All considered, it feels like they're designed for you to learn throughout the process: the best test design in my opinion. \n\n***Homework (3 assignments)***\nThe homeworks can be a lot of reading and writing, but there's only 3 of them so you just have to get through them. It could be worse, there's way more of this in a class like HCI. \n\n***Project (3 parts)***\nI really enjoyed the projects because they were where you got to practice designing and implementing an agent. You have your pick of java or python; if you don't know where to start, there is more starter code than it seems, just ask around on piazza. The main drawback is that I (and I believe most people) were able to get away without using most of the concepts we learned. There are technically 3 projects but they're really just 3 parts of one, each having you solve different problem sets of Ravens Progressive Matrices. \n\n***Project Tips***\n* There is a decently large writing component, but its honestly not bad if you write it as intended, and even helps you plan more: Write Intro before touching the code, write each journal section immediately after submitting, and conclusion at end. For the first project, I wrote my entire report afterward and it just became tedious, ingenue, and I discovered things while writing that could have helped me.  \n* Don't try to make your project pass ALL local tests before submitting: allow room for improvement. I tried making all pass before my first submission for the first project and regretted it. It allows for only minimal tweaking as you have to submit a good number of times, and you'll just waste your time. \n* Start using the images in the first project: you'll thank yourself down the road. \n\n***Participation (peer reviews, piazza, etc)***\nDepending on your piazza activity, this part honestly just sucks. If you want to avoid piazza, you have to do 9 reviews per assignment (3 homeworks + 3 project reports) which can become energy-sucking. Being active on Piazza is honestly just a necessity: for us shy folks, I promise its not as terrible as it seems, just go for it.",

You can use approaches from the lectures or bake your own. Don't over think it, my best solving routine ended up being the simplest.\n\nThe homeworks are 8 page papers. Be sure you answer every question in the rubric. They must follow jdf document standard. I highly recommend using the provided latex template and Overleaf.com (free pro account if you use GT email address). If you don't know latex spend about 20 minutes to learn the basics; it may even help in other courses.\n\nExams are open book, but do use proctortrack. Unlike many others I had zero issue with it. Exams are relatively low weight on your grade so don't sweat them. I'm a note taker and that was enough just to read over my notes once before each test and make moderately well.\n\nOther grades were participation and performance bonus for top 10 project submissions.\n\nOverall a great course for a first semester, or if you may be disconnected some during the semester. All information for the semester is clearly laid out at the beginning of the semester, so you can work ahead if you like on most of it.",

This isn't a deep learning, RL, ML course, so people who expect to come in learning those things are often disappointed. But guess what, you need to know this stuff because deep learning isn't the future. This class is about different subareas which are critical in the broader conversation in AI.

This is strictly enforced, with heavy penalties.\n\nIf you follow the rules exactly as written, you will do fine. \n\n### Exams\n\nThere are 3 exams, worth 5% each (15% total), open-book multiple-selection, each focusing on a third of the course, where you will get points for all correctly selected and correctly unselected statements. It covers the course lectures only. It can feel a bit like answering tricky trivia questions on the material.\n\n### Projects\n\nThere is one big project, split into 3 submissions of increasing complexity over the term, worth 15% each (45% total). For our term, we had to build an agent that is able to visually solve visual IQ puzzles using Python, Numpy, and Pillow only (or Java equivalent).\n\nThere are good ways to use the course material to solve this challenge, but that is not required. You will have no guidance here beyond the technical limitations and the theoretical lecture material; implementation is completely open ended and up to you.\n\n### Assignments\n\nThere are 3 assignments, worth 10% each (30% total), consisting of 4 questions apiece. One question on the course material. Two that are focused on soft topics like ethics, or analysis of papers, or trends in AI regulation. And a final open question about things like popular culture or media coverage.\n\n### Participation\n\n10% of the total grade is attributed to participation in peer-reviews, forum discussion, survey participation, etc. \n\n### Work Ahead\n\nThe course site is public on:\nhttp://lucylabs.gatech.edu/kbai/\n\nYou may work ahead, but you're also taking a gamble that the material does not change from previous terms.\n\n### Opinion\n\nThere are two lecturers, one of which has a thick unintelligible accent. The \"ebook\" is a compilation of the lecture transcripts, with errors. There is room for improvement here.\n\nThe material is interesting, but is dwarfed by the performance of Machine / Deep Learning systems; this is a hotly contested topic (though it may be telling that the best performing project made use of a neural network, rather than the classical AI methods taught in the course lectures). The way forward for knowledge based AI in industry may be via a hybrid implementation with Deep Learning methods.\n\nI feel the Project could have used some guidance to relate it to the course material. I was not a fan of the way rules were strictly enforced, but understand the rationale for doing so.\n\nIf you like writing papers, this course is for you. If you prefer code implementation, there are better options geared towards that.",

If you are interested in the conceptual nature of it and are willing to work through some of the coding on your own, you will enjoy it. tests are effectively 75 T/F questions disguised as MC. low % of grade. Most of the course work is some longer, writing based assignments and a longer project that can be programmed in python or java. I don't have a ton of python coding experience, but I was able to pick up enough to do fairly well on the project. would definitely recommend this course.",

                        "body": "Knowledge Based AI consists of 3 projects,  3 writing assignments and 3 exams.\n1. The project involves writing an AI agent that can solve Raven\u2019s Progressive Matrices (RPM), a visual human intelligence test. Students can use either Python w/ PIL or Java. The amount of time students put into this project seemed to vary considerably based on the rigor and approach to the problem, such as reimplementing academic papers on RPM versus just using simple black pixel counting. You can do either a visual or verbal approach. Visual is probably easier since advanced image processing or computer vision techniques are not necessary to do well on the project and verbal cannot be used in the final project.\n2. Each writing assignment consists of 4 questions each with each answer requiring 2 pages. The questions target AI ethics, AI in society/culture, applying KBAI lecture material as well as reflecting on academic AI papers. It is best to start thinking about these questions early to get the most learning benefit. I found the writing assignments really fun to research and went down many interesting rabbit holes in the process of doing them, especially on the academic/conference paper questions.\n3. The exams consisted of 15 questions with 5 choices with Joyner style grading (effectively making the test 75 questions). Getting As on the test requires watching all the lectures. Notes and lecture transcripts can be referenced during the exams.\n\nOverall, I think this is a good course, though I am unsure how I will apply the knowledge I\u2019ve gained since a lot of the lecture material is very theoretical. Despite the coding project, I don\u2019t think I have a good idea of how I would implement or use much of what was presented. It is a class that offers some flexibility in time you need to commit since everything is available upfront. You can get an A by putting forth average effort, but can also go much deeper if the subject captures you and aim for exemplary designations and bonus points for going above and beyond.",

This is a survey course designed to familiarize students with the high-level concepts being explored in a huge variety of ways within the knowledge-based school of AI. I will concede that the course could have used more practical implementation examples to help solidify how you'd actually apply the concepts, but what I took away is that there are lots and lots of ways to implement the concepts we discussed.

Be prepared to do a lot of self learning to complete it.\n\nI really enjoyed the peer review system, although about halfway through the semester I had maxed out my review score and didn't give any other reviews.",

The course is very writing heavy, the minimum amount of writing required for full credit is ~42 pages, the maximum maximum is 69 pages.

Excellent way to focus on exploring interesting areas of the material. Loved how students had freedom to choose which topic(s) they wanted to explore. Peer reviews were great way to have students review other papers, learn how to review other topics, see examples of writing from peers, and judge their work against others.\n\nProject(s) were to explore Ravens Progressive Matrices, an IQ test based upon images. Challenging as I had avoided graphics much of my career, and students were not allowed to use advanced image processing features. Forced to be creative, and consider how humans examine images and find similarities. I interviewed over 20 colleagues to learn how they approached RPM, and incorporated some of their strategies into my agent. I loved how the projects revisited the same problem as we learned and applied more AI techniques and refined our approaches.\n\nThe review of peer student papers and projects has been unique so far in the program (9 courses completed), and one of the most effective techniques for teaching/learning.\n\nFinal exam was take-home, open book, open notes. Enabled student to really explore material and explain what they learned.\n\nI would suggest that a student delay taking KBAI until they have completed 1-2 courses and adjusted to the program. They will gain more benefit from the course as a result."

The topics are partly philosophical and partly on the lecture material, but overall the prompts feel \"squishy\" and subjective. There is a project writeup portion where you can discuss your code implementation in practical terms, but even there you have to add interpretations of \"how your agent relates to human cognition\". \n\nI strongly disliked the RPM project and that killed my motivation for the course. At least in other courses where you have various projects, there is probably one that you end up liking, but with KBAI, you have to grind away at the same problem without learning any useful techniques from the lectures. I signed up for this course hoping to work on a chatbot, but that project was only offered for one semester and apparently it did not go well enough to continue supporting.\n\nIf you like psychology, then you'll probably like the lectures. I'm sure the course creators spent a lot of time consolidating the material into the lectures, but it's a very high level introduction to a lot of different ideas. Having finished the course, I don't really know that I learned much.\n\nThough Dr. Joyner is engaged on Piazza, there isn't an avenue to discuss the course material, which means that if you have questions about the lectures, you better hope that one of your class peers can explain it. The syllabus lists a Slack channel for office hours, but none of the teaching staff or TAs answered any questions posted to that channel during the entire semester. There are two instructors for this course, but one disappeared towards the end of the course, maybe due to health reasons, and the course structure deteriorated a bit. \n\nI dislike the grading process. Dr. Joyner does not like to release the grading rubric and I found that the feedback I received wasn't useful or explanatory. Also, make sure to keep submitting project attempts to Bonnie, even after you have a passing grade. Points are deducted if you don't keep trying to improve your score and you haven't made very many attempts.\n\nClearly some people love this course, but it did not match my expectations based on other courses in this program.",

The lecture is very high-level, which keeps talking about some obvious things and skip technical details for each topic.\n\nWe had 3 writing assignments and each is about 10 pages. The homework asks weird questions (e.g. to summarize paper/political document/news).\n\nWe had 3 exams throughout the semester and they are open book. The content is related to lectures and each exam has 15 multiple selection questions. It is not difficult to get an average score if using ctrl+f to search in the book, but it is still challenging to get a high score.\n\nWe had 3 projects to solve Raven's Matrix Problems. This is the only component that I feel is interesting in this course. An AI agent needs to be designed to solve the problems given and either Java or Python can be used. The grade of projects is based on three components, the best performance of your agent, the effort in making progress of your agent, and the report. I feel this kind of rubric is very reasonable.\n\nOverall, if you like high-level discussions about AI topics and if you are ok with a lot of writings, then this might be a good course for you.",

The TAs are very involved and Dr. Joyner is the most active instructor I've met so far. There were numerous cases where students requested more time for projects and were actually granted it! \n\nThe quality and interest of lectures is pretty great, as are the exercises and questions they pose. However, there is definitely some hand-waviness to them as some of the deeper concepts are not fully explained to the level I would expect in a CS Masters.\n\nHomeworks are easy points and attempt to quiz you on material from the lectures. In reality, they are just long writing assignments. I consider them to be busy work as I've learned very little besides some ethical points of view on AI. I recommend banging them out in a day or two and spending time getting ahead on the projects. I was able to do this and get a 20/20 on 2/3 homeworks. (homework 3 grade is still tbd at this point in time)\n\nTests are easy and open notes. You will have no problem getting a decent grade on them, and I don't even think you really need to study. Just watch the lectures, take some notes, and you'll be fine.\n\nProjects are based on Raven's Progressive Matrices, a visual human intelligence test. Never has there been a larger disconnect between course lectures and application of that material. You will apply exactly 0 of the lectures to the project. Instead, you will spend 90% of your time doing visual processing, so get comfortable with numpy. (And forget PIL, PIL sucks) Try as much as possible to use vectorized operations instead of going pixel by pixel so that your performance doesn't suffer. There were many students who did not apply the visual approach until Project 3, and they struggled a LOT! Also, do yourself a favor and read the relevant sections of the ASTI model of solving these matrices. It will pretty much guarantee you will meet the performance requirements of the first two projects using the visual approach. \n\n My biggest complaint with the course is that literally none of the lectures will apply to the projects you work on. I want to give this course a higher rating, but I know that in a month, most of the material I have learned will be forgotten because I never got to apply it. I cannot forgive that, and all I can really say is that I have a faux-intelligent RPM solver with a lot of overfitted if-else conditions and a bunch of useless notes at the end of the day!",

You'll have the opportunity to tackle a fun project, but you likely won't really learn anything useful.\n\nPros\n- The project is a 3 part project where you solve [Raven's Progressive Matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raven%27s_Progressive_Matrices)). It's pretty interesting and fun. You have a lot of freedom to solve the problem however you want and you can build on your previous work in the later projects.\n- The class is well run. TAs and the professor are reasonably active on Piazza* and seem to care about creating a positive experience.\n- If you're into ethical AI dilemmas or thought experiments involving AI, the homework problems can be quite interesting. \n- The exams are not difficult - they basically require that you watched the lecture and took organized notes. \n\nCons\n- The lecture material is way to high level to be useful. Literally every lecture would ask \"how can we get an agent to do X\" and then fail to answer the question. For example, the question that asked \"how could we get an agent to understand a sentence?\" talked a lot about a specific framework that can be used to more meaningfully store sentences, but said diddly-squat about how you would actually get the agent to recognize different parts of the sentence to actually build the representation.\n- (*) The course staff tends to ignore questions about actual course material. I don't think I've seen an instructor response to any questions that ask deeper questions about course material. They also tend to ignore good faith questions about the course management process or ways to improve the course. \n- If you're not into ethical AI dilemmas or thought experiments involving AI, the homework problems will be tedious.\n- It's really easy to \"game\" the project if you find the right resources on google.\n\nIf you're looking for a reasonably easy course that will give you some food for thought (or if you're looking for a busywork class that you can get an easy A in), you may enjoy this class. However, if you're looking for a course that will teach you something about AI, I would recommend giving this class a miss.",

                        "body": "In short, this class doesn't teach anything useful outside of solving toy problems. The real world isn't a 3x3 grid of shapes with 8 answers. I'd much rather take a class on Probabilistic Graphical Models, Bayesian Statistics, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, or any other topic that has applications to the real world. If you agree with my sentiment, stay away from this course.\n\nThe lectures are devoid of substance; they basically consist of defining terms that are never used for anything useful. Here's an example of what you can expect from the lectures: \n\n> **Lecture**: Abduction means given a rule and an effect, abduce a cause.\n\n> **Me**: Okay, great, how can we use this 'abduction' to solve the problem at hand? What algorithm can we apply? This is a CS course afterall.\n\n> *Lecture ends*\n\nThe homework assignments are essentially busy work (lots of writing) with no return on investment. The project (IMO) doesn't leverage any of the course material. In fact, I'd wager that you'd be worse off if you tried to apply the course material (somehow) to the project, as opposed to just implementing a paper that describes a visual-based algorithm. \n\nThe exam questions focus on how well you understood their esoteric AI terminology that isn't used anywhere else outside of the course. \n\nTo end on a positive note, Dr. Joyner is an enthusiastic professor who actively participates on Piazza. If he freshens up or modernizes the material then perhaps KBAI can be salvaged.",

Some computer vision could help but is not necessary.\n\nI heeded advice of a previous poster to keep it simple on the projects.  You don't have to do things perfectly to get an A.\n\nHomeworks are \"easy\" in that you can do well with effort alone.

If yes, then you should look elsewhere.\n\nBut if spending 20 minutes pondering whether or not an anthill is conscious and then another 20 minutes writing half a page on your thoughts sounds interesting to you, then you will really enjoy this course.\n\n###  Course Quality\nThis course is amazingly well run. It is clear that a lot of time was spent putting together thoughtful lectures that built on each other and introduced complex topics in a way that makes them seem easy. \n\n_Side note: I feel like many of the complaints are that this course is too \"easy\" and not \"graduate-level\" work, but I'm sure that worse instructors could make the topics seem very difficult. That is what smart, thoughtful people do, they make complicated things easy to understand._\n\n###  Homeworks\nYou will have to write. You will write a lot. Are some of the questions busywork-ish? Yes. But if you've got the time to put thought into the questions, most are as interesting as you want to make them.\n\n### Exams\nThese are kind of, meh. I mean, they have to make sure you've watched the lectures, so if you've watched all the lectures and can ctrl+f through a pdf, it's nothing to stress about.\n\n### Projects\nSolving the Ravens Progressive Matrices was a really enjoyable series of challenges, and each project builds on the previous one. Like another reviewer said, if you go visual for the first project, you can save yourself a world of pain for project 2 and 3.\n\n### Overall\nIf you take this course simply because it looks easy on OMSCentral and you want to churn through some credit hours, then you can, but everything will feel like pointless busywork and you'll hate it (but hey, you'll have only spent 6 hours/week and gotten a B and are 3 credit hours closer to a degree). \n\nHowever, if you don't mind stopping and smelling the roses for a bit instead of just churning out lines of code, then you could have a really nice time in this course.",

I forget if the assignments were as well but I feel like yes. Can work ahead, woohoo!\n* Some of the assignment questions were fun.\n* The project was fun. You could brute-force your way to victory if you didn't actually have time for Grad School (this was my situation as I was working and taking another class), or you can really apply what you learn and try to do interesting things. This seems like a pipe dream to me in this program. There are other assignments and tests and life so I felt that I had no time for that, but some people did really cool things.\n\nCons:\n* This is a cognitive science class with some computer science mixed in. Other than the project, you will not be doing any programming. Only writing and writing about theories of the mind and AI. If that's your thing, cool. If not, you're gonna tear out your hair answering questions like \"what is an example of a good\\evil AI in media?\" Like... really? What is the point of this question? \n* The assignments are really time consuming.\n* There are tests... ugh.\n\nOverall, it's a required class for some specialties so no choice, but also did I mention NO GROUP PROJECT?"

Don't expect to take away \"practical\" knowledge as most of the stuff taught are very generic and abstract concepts about intelligence and representation, extraction, understanding of information/knowledge.    \n\nThe course has 3 exams - which is good pacing because there are just too many concepts to learn and it would be difficult if these were to be crammed for just 2 exams. No additional reading required for the exams. But, you need to properly understand the lecture material. You can't get away using just ctrl-f to search for stuff and answer the questions... (these are open-everything tests)  \n\nThe tests were fine, but I wish they were more \"application\" oriented - meaning, it would have been better if the questions asked how concept _x_ can be used to solve problem _p_ or something like that.   \n\nThe homeworks were the most interesting part of the course for me. Lots of interesting questions to be answered. \n\nI hated the supposedly popular \"raven's matrices\" projects. The aim is to build an agent to solve intelligence test problems - probably using the concepts taught in the class, but I did not feel like I learned anything by doing these projects (even though my agent got pretty good scores). The methods I (and probably most of the students) used are nowhere near how humans think about solving these problems and for me, it was just \"use and do whatever\" to get the highest possible score so I don't really understand the point of this project... I think the NLP related chatbot would have been a better option, but that was not offered as a choice in my semester.",

You need an interest in AI more specifically human-like or general purpose AI, else you might get frustrated soon.  \n2. All 3 projects will run fast, you really need to be comfortable with Python(Numpy) or Java. \n3. If you have not taken CV already you might need to quickly read some paper and be able to implement them.  But this should be perfectly fine as long as you are comfortable with the chosen language.  \n4. You really need to surf a lot online to do the 3 assignments.   Like, read very fast, summarize and present the ideas in 2 pages along with your own opinion.\n5. You should be able to take brilliant notes and keep them handy for the exams.  The 3 exams are the weirdest I've ever taken.  Good understanding of the concepts taught in the lecture is a must to crack the exams. \n\n### What I liked?\nDefinitely, I liked the theories that were taught in this course.  It is a fuel to your thoughts and imagination, you will learn concepts that you can apply to any AI problem, the problem is it will NOT be as easy as it sounds and you might feel they are too abstract.  \nThe project is interesting, you will most probably enjoy the project itself with the journals and peer reviews.  On the other side, they don't necessarily relate to the theories you learn in this class.  You can use them for the project but eventually, you will find easier ways to get the agent working that will drive you away from the course materials. \n\n\nIf you want to get an A, you can do it with minimal work.

More theory than practical/technical than I would have liked, but my main goal was just to test how I could balance a easy/medium difficult class for the start of my grad school career with the rest of my life.\n\nFull disclaimer, my goal was to put in the minimum amount of work necessary to get an A. The number of hours per week was about 6, but that's an average, there were definitely weeks where I put in 0 hours, and the week before a project was due I would put in >6. It's very much a 'get out what you put in' type of class. There's tons of optional readings that I'm sure are interesting if I decided to read them.\n\nSo the wide variance in #of hours people put in is because of the projects. The projects are as hard as you want them to be. If you want to fine tune your AI agent's performance, try lots of different techniques, read a bunch of technical papers and try the algorithms explained there, go right ahead. You'll probably learn a lot more than I did and have fun doing it. \n\nBut DO NOT believe the reviews that complain how time intensive they are. The bar for getting an A on these projects is very low. You don't need to be a python wizard. You don't need to be a numpy wizard (I had never used it before. I barely can say I know anything about it now). You don't need to use any fancy algorithms. I implemented the dumbest thing possible to get the bare minimum results necessary to get full points. And since the projects build on each other, I just had to tweak them slightly to get those results for each subsequent project. And for a graduate class full of current/aspiring software engineers/technologists, I was shocked how many did not understand how to KISS (keep it simple, stupid). \n\nDo yourself a favor if you're trying to save time and start with a visual approach from project 1. It'll make your life a lot easier by the time you get to project 2 and 3, and it's honestly quicker to solve the problems than the verbal approach, albeit a bit more intimidating/more upfront work/learning.\n\nAnd for those reviews complaining about the exams. Personally I thought they were pretty easy. But even so, they're worth so little of your grade that you can fail them and still get an A in the course.",

It's a gentle ramp-up, and since it's a medium difficulty course, you can gauge what type of effort will be required for the more harder courses in the future.\n\nThere are 3 homework assignments, 3 proctored exams, and 3 projects. Projects have more weight, followed by exams and homework. Homeworks and projects require a lot of writing. 50% of the project grades are dedicated to the journal, where you explain your thought process behind the code you submit. Homework is fully written assignments, so be prepared to write a lot.\n\nThere are grade points for participation as well (posting on Piazza, doing peer feedbacks, etc.). Very easy to get if you log in once a day to Piazza and take 2 mins answering very easy questions some classmates might put up. Also, peer feedback can be fun. Reading approaches to projects your classmates have used might end up being helpful, but do not rely on you getting good feedbacks. Most of the time, people just copy paste \"Great job\" to every feedback and you can do the same.\n\nTAs and Dr.Joyner (the professor) are really helpful and participate in piazza very frequently. It's also easy to get an A in this class. I did all my assignments the weekend before the submission date (one long night per alternate week) and could complete all of the work a few hours before the deadline. It's very easy to frontload the work (you should especially do that with projects). Exams were open-book and comparatively easy to score. \n\nThe only problem is this course is very theory-centric. It teaches abstract concepts about AI which might not help you at any point in the future or offer any good insight into the current world of AI development. The project is unrelated to the coursework and requires you to build logic around solving problems rather than an AI-like approach towards problem-solving.\n\nOverall a great course. A very theory focused, but slightly enjoyable course nonetheless.",

I recommend taking detailed notes because the exams basically test exact wording and can be very tricky.\n\n2) Homework. Three homework assignments of ~10 pages each. I would say these are the least fun things in the course. Some questions allow for some creative and fun responses, and some include valuable review of course topics, but there are too many about AI ethics and unrelated stuff. The formatting required is also a little annoying (though not difficult because of the provided template). The difficulty is not high, it just takes a while.\n\n3) The project. This required designing a program to solve Raven's Progressive Matrices. You can choose Java or python, and you can use a verbal or visual approach for the first two project submissions, and only visual for the last one. I HIGHLY recommend using python and a visual approach from the start. This is the biggest time sink, though it's pretty engaging. If you're a whiz and choose a good implementation, you might have a good enough solution halfway through the course and be able to take it easier later.\n\nThis was my first OMSCS course, and I came into it with only C++ experience and no python, numpy, or AI knowledge, and I was able to do fine. I took this course alone (but with a fulltime job), but I was never pressed for time. Assignment due dates are spread out, and you can work ahead if you have a trip or something. I would be perfectly content if all OMSCE courses were like this one.",

The projects are broken into core parts that all build off of each other. The goal is to solve raven's progressive matrix problem. If you take this course, take my suggestion and theirs and solve based on images from the start (not the descriptions). Doing so will save you a lot of rework time in the future. The course also heavily uses PeerFeedback, a tool to review papers from others students. Throughout the course your project papers and general homework papers will go on here to be reviewed by other students. I rather enjoyed the papers and the project papers as well as reading and reviewing others' work.  Overall I really liked this course, the format, and the projects.

A lot of what is seen in the course is not used too much in the industry, but you can draw many relationships between the course material and other areas such as ML (at a really high level). You can really do the course in any order that you want. The course consists of a breadth and a depth component. \n\n##\u00a0Breadth component\n\nEach lecture explains a different concept of KBAI. At the beginning of the course, there's a lot of relations between the content, but it starts to drop as you go further in the lectures. The 3 homeworks consist of 4 questions, one or two of them will be directly related to the lectures. The other will ask you to write. Be ready to write and read a lot. In the whole semester I've written around 18K words. Each homework will be 8-10 pages long. Some of them are interesting questions that connect general aspects of AI with society and ethical issues.\n\n##\u00a0Depth component\n\nThere are 3 projects which focus in solving Ravens Progressive Matrices. When watching the lectures, you can see how you can connect the concepts from the lectures with RPMs. In the practice, there are simpler ways of solving the problems (like using simple heuristics) that have decent performance. Some people program thousands of lines in this course, but this is not a programming intensive course. To be fair, I wrote <100 lines for each of the projects.\n\n#\u00a0Workload\nI did an explanation of the workload:\n\nCourse content - 25 hours \n \n3 projects - 15 hours each - 45\n\n3 homeworks - 15 hours each - 45\n\nPeer feedback and participation- 10 hours\n\n3 exams (including prep.) - 10 hours\n\n**Total time: 8 hours aprox.** You should probably estimate a bit higher. There are a lot of optional readings so this number can go a lot higher. You make what you want from this course. The material is not too hard. The tests are a bit tricky because of the wording, but the average is quite high.",

For newbie in AI field like me, I spent a lot of time on this class. This class is not difficulty but a lot of assignments. 3 homework (10 pages per homework), 3 projects include journal writing, 3 exams. To finish assignments, you have to spend a lot of time.\n\nUnlucky, I was very busy with my work and family this semester too. I did finish most assignments but the performance is not good. Prof is not active frequently. TA answered most question on behalf of prof, sometimes I did not know exactly prof post or TA post the answer. However, very slow response from TA at the end of semester.\n\n* 3 homework: each homework have 4 long questions, require a lot of researching, reading a lot of papers, write a 8-10 pages paper. Be careful with format paper and citation.\n\n* 3 projects: The project is solving Raven Progressive Matrices problems. Not too difficulty, but require deep programming skill to optimize the source code. If you select python, be sure you are master of numpy. You have to submit multiple times with different approach. You have to write a journal for each project, at least 5 pages.\n\nThe biggest issue I got at the last day of project 3 due date. It is too late. They used auto-grader called Bonnie to grade your project. I used python and did calculation at bit level (using a lot of loop 2d array). That is a very big mistake. Bonnie is very slow with bit calculation. I found out at the last day of project 3 due day when I submitted my agent. It took 42 minutes to run at my laptop but ran forever after I submitted to Bonnie. \n\nI wished I know this issue before. TA and prof did not tell you anything about the optimization. That the reason why I wrote review here. If you select this class, you have to consider this issue. You should master numpy. Do not use bit level calculation.\n\n* 3 exams: the exams only cover the lectures. But you need to understand deeply. if you are the newbie in AI, maybe you cannot get high score. The answers for questions are much similar. Some answer sound like True but it actually False. It is very abstract.\n\n* You have to did 6 peer review for 3 homework and 3 project journals to earn participation grade. \nEach review requires 4 papers at least. So total you could read 3x4x10 + 3x4x5 = 180 pages at least for review. \n\nThe exam/homework/project are not relevant. Student can get high grade in project but may be get low grade in exam.",

As someone who is very interested in AI, I found this class to be spot on for helping to further introduce me to the field. They discuss cognitive architectures and do a great of of helping you to understand how they work and what they focus on.\n\nThe projects build off of themselves so you can continue to improve your approach throughout the semester. This was my favorite part of the course. By the end, I felt like I had built something to be proud of but this came with a large, but sporadic, time commitment.\n\nIt was my first course in the program so a large part of my learning was around how to work more efficiently. I highly recommend this as a first course, especially if you are interested in true AI.\n\nThe TA's and professor were fantastic and made it feel like a community. Class participation is 10% of your grade, but it is easy to obtain points.\n\nOverall I'm very happy that I took this course!",

Professor Goyal was amazing and very engaged as an instructor.\n\nKBAI is more of a classical view of AI, unlike the AI that is heavily reliant on humungous amounts of data.\nThe projects involved solving Raven's Progressive Matrices increasing in difficulty. There was also peer-peer evaluation of the assignments (only the report parts) which gave a chance to view others approach towards the same assignments.\n\nThere was an option to opt for an NLP based alternate project instead of continuing with the RPM project. It was about implementing a chatbot agent that could answer course related queries.  I had opted for this. The course officially did not cover NLP in the lectures and we had to do our own research on it.\n\nAnother really interesting aspect of this class: few of the TAs were actually chatbot agents! The class itself was also an ongoing research on AI by Dr. Goyal. For more on this see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbCguICyfTA\n\nThe grading was curved and I ended up with a low A. \n\nTAs did a commendable job. Overall this was a very well managed class."

The course is very informative and well run, but you will do a lot of writing and you are not allowed to rewrite anything, and the tests are designed to trick you so studying is rather pointless; just guess and pray. \n\nI will have to retake the entire semester because one of my essays was not well written as I was so busy with another very hard class, I dropped the other class but it was already too late. Just take one class at a time at GAtech, even courses like this one that are not initially hard will be revamped until you start bleeding. I really liked the material but the grading has nothing to do with how much you have learned.\n\nNo curve(anymore), no regrades(anymore) and the extra credit required you to have the top results in class, so unless you're already a python wiz you won't get that either. I am so burnt out and cannot wait to finish this degree, but it's my fault I was really trying to learn and grow before I took this class. Not at GAtech, just pass the autograder; like in highschool that's all that matters is a grade. Do your research and real learning elsewhere.",

Can work ahead and knock these out early which is nice.\n\n**Exams** 3 exams which cover concept definitions, applied examples, and details about specific concepts. Very much a Joyner exam if you've taken one of his courses before. Open everything with a 1 hour time limit. No curve.\n  \n**Projects**  You build an AI agent that can solve Raven's matrices problems (intelligence test problems). The project is broken into three phases, and you submit your agent along with a reflection/write up through the semester.  The project was interesting, but I didn't change my agent's strategy after the first submission. I recommended taking the visual approach from the start. It's a little more work up front, but you have to use the visual approach on the third phase of the project.\n\nFuture iterations might have a different project focused on NLP. Would love to see that.  \n\n**Pre-reqs** You don't need a ton of background to do well in the course. Some experience programming in Python or Java will help.

The paper does a good job at introducing you to the AI world, but it barely even scratched the surface - I found the complexity of the video lectures, the programming assignments(3), the non-programming assignments(3), and the exams unfitting for a graduate paper in a top grade CS program.\n\nBarring that, make no mistake that the paper was extremely well-run - the instructor (Prof Joyner) was very active and responsive on both piazza and slack; the TAs were extremely committed and helpful and there was nothing to complain about on the administrative side of things either.\n\nOverall, I recommend this course more as a filler course if you want an easy one to club with a difficult paper, but from a learning standpoint, I feel disappointed."

This reflects on the TAs' behavior and the overall quality of the course. There is a lot of writing involved, which it was a plus for me as I love it. But it is something to consider if you don't like writing that much. There is simply no way around it as all homeworks and projects require a 10-page essay. The course was taken on Fall 2018, and some changes were introduced to the course in relation to past semesters. For example, the projects used to have a curve and be graded solely on the performance of the AI agent submitted. For this semester, that component was reduced to be 30% of the grade, with another 20% coming from the improvement progress presented and the other 50% from the essay about the submitted agent. I hear the professor is considering some other changes that, if implemented, in my opinion, will improve the course even more for future semesters.\n\nThis is one of those courses that one gets back what ones puts in. On my case, I ended up putting over 30 hours/week, not by necessity for the A, but simply because it is a subject that interests me a lot. But I can see people still getting the A with maybe 12-16 hours/week. Especially if you come with a solid Python background. Not a difficult course for an A, supper interesting topic, engaged students and great professor. Can't go wrong with that combo!",

You'll need to experiment with various techniques in order to solve the different kinds of problems around. I didn't especially like the \"implementation points\" section, but actually it seems that it's mostly free points for many people, so, it's not bad either. You must write a report along your implementation, and that report is 50% of your project score.\n\nPersonally, I didn't like the exams. They felt more about wordplay and discerning ambiguities, rather than verifying if people understood or knew some content. But that doesn't mean they're overwhelming difficult.\n\nYou can mostly frontload work, since the syllabus is complete from the beginning, but while you can implement your agent, you won't be able to test it his \"matching\" set from the beginning, so you may be forced to revisit it later on. \n\nAll in all: a solid, well run, medium-difficulty, interesting class.",

The projects used Java or Python, and you can work ahead. Overall, an interesting course on AI, with lots of theory and also practical work in the projects. This semester, we had Raven's Progressive Matrices in the projects, but it looks like there will be some new projects in the upcoming semesters. It's not a very hard course, so it's suitable for students early in the program. Enjoyed it quite a lot and made me think both about AI and my own thinking.",

The professor was heavily involved, and this was the most \"academic\" course I have taken in the program.

I loved the lectures and I spent way too much time on each of the assignments, so this was a big time sink for me.  I am a decent python programmer and found the projects consumed multiple weekends to complete.  I rated this class to be \"Hard\", but I spent a lot of time on it and got an A, and I think you would find similar success.  Outside of the repetitive projects, this class was one of my favorites.",

The interaction with TAs, Professor and fellow students on Piazza was one of the highlights. Much of the course centers around 3 projects that implement an AI agent to solve Raven's Progressive Matrices. This semester there was an alternate project offered for projects 2 and 3 for a select number of students that implemented a chatbot. In hindsight I wish I had taken the opportunity. I believe the chatbot project will be offered to more students in future semesters. My only gripe is that we didn't have more project based work that allowed us to implement techniques learned later in the course. The Raven's projects really only implemented techniques learned in the first few weeks. Be prepared for a lot of writing. Also, you can put as much time as you want into this course so it is a little dangerous. The homeworks and projects are very open ended.",

They are actually around all the time and are still experimenting with and improving the course even though this is one of the oldest courses in the program. Professor Goel is going to stop teaching this course starting next semester, but it will still be taught by Professor Joyner (and Bobbie Eicher), so you can still expect a lot of instructor involvement. The course does open book exams without proctortrack, which is personally my favorite mode of doing exams since proctortrack is so constraining. Decent amount of freedom to explore and experiment in the assignments if that's what you want to do.\n\nMy main issue (and it is a big one) is that the material itself feels pretty dated: knowledge-based AI isn't really in fashion in our age of ML and deep learning, so I took this course to see if there was still interesting techniques in that domain, and frankly I don't think I've been convinced: there is *a lot* of material in this course, but much of it seems obvious, brittle, or excessively vague. Also there seems to be a lot of repetition in the material, where techniques that are extremely similar get presented separately due to what I think are very minor differences.\n\nIn summary: this is a well-taught course. It does require you to write a lot but you don't need to be a genius to get an A, just do your work consistently. However, don't expect your mind to be blown by the material, and be aware that you are learning about an area of AI that is now fairly outdated.",

There are *3 assignments*, *a 3-stage class project*, and *peer-reviews* for all assignments and project stages.\n\n**Assignments**:The 3 assignments are essentially essays that ask you to leverage class material to either a specific topic or a topic of your choosing (depending on the assignment). You often have a choice between which material you wish to discuss, so as long as you illustrate you understood those topics and provide a reasonable answer to solve the posed problem it's not too difficult. I would recommend using lots of figures, since the word limit can sometimes be tight, so flowcharts, pseudocode and illustrations in general are very helpful. Make sure to answer all rubric questions provided for each assignment.\n\n**Projects**:The class project is broken into 3 stages. The main overall class project is to develop an AI agent that can solve Ravens Progressive Matrices, a standardized test of intelligence. I say main project since they also allow you the option to complete an alternate project for projects 2 and 3, which involves developing an AI agent chatbot that can answer questions based on answers from an FAQ. At each stage, you deal with progressively harder requirements / problem sets, and you will need to also write a project reflection describing your approach, what you learned and how it connects to KBAI topics. Start projects early, so you don't feel overwhelmed trying to rush things last minute. Don't neglect the written reflection too, as it's normally 40-50% of each project, and make sure to again follow the project rubric to make sure you answer all questions on each rubric.\n\n**Exams**:There are 2 take-home examinations, which aren't too difficult. They are essay-based, much like the rest of the course aside from project implementations, and you  have a week to complete each exam.\n\n**Peer Review**:You will also need to complete peer review for all assignments, all 3 project reflections, and the mid-term and final exams. They don't want single sentence sort of peer reviews, so you will have to put a bit of effort into leaving some good feedback here.\n\n**TAs**: TAs and the prof were all very active on Piazza. There were a few grading hiccups towards the end of this semester, but they were rapid in addressing these issues and correcting mistakes where necessary. I believe the prof, Dr. Goel, is stepping down and there will be a new prof so I'm not so sure if the exact structure of the course will be as described above, so take these notes with a grain of salt.\n\n**Prep**: This is a good first class, but if you aren't comfortable with Python or Java then you should get brush up on one of these prior to starting the class. Most people use Python, and if you want to complete the alternate Chatbot project, it is **only Python**.  Prepare for a lot of writing, as in total I wrote about 11-13k words across all assignments, project reflections, and exams.",

My background is in electrical engineering so my software development skills are limited compared to others working through their OMSCS degree.  This course provides the option to utilize either Python or Java to work through the three projects that build on each other throughout the semester in order to develop an AI agent that is able to solve Raven's Progressive Matrices problems.  I found the material extremely interesting.  It is a bit of a jump for those with limited software development experience translating the theoretical course material and applying it to the projects, but extremely manageable after dedicating the expected amount of time.  Three assignments must also be completed throughout the semester that are 1000-1500 word essays on various topics taught throughout the course.   The midterm and final exams are both take home essays that must be completed within one week and the expected word counts are 2000 and 3000 words respectively.  It is a very well run course and the TA's and professor are extremely active within Piazza.",

Yes, we do agree diagrams will help illustrate the ideas, but it shouldn't play such a large part in grading\n- The Projects are about solving RPM problems by building an AI Agent, it sounds like a real AI project, however from my personal experience, it feels like a normal programming assignment, the `Intelligence` part is not that much...\n\nFinal Exam Drama:\n- So the prof posted final exam paper, which is a writing assignment. After three days when many people have finished the paper, they found out that the solution to one question (Q3) is available online. They took that question done and posted another version of final exam paper, many people's efforts in that question are now in void.\n- The worst part occurred in grading Q2, Q2 is a perfect example to be solved using version space as per discussed in lecture videos, it could be solved using Incremental learning concept as well, they are largely interchangeable and there is no absolutely right or wrong. Students who use version spaces concept didn't get much credit, when being questioned, the prof's response is like below\n\n```\nBriefly, the original final examination contained a specific question on version spaces using the same data as for Q1 and Q2 in the current final exam. Given that we had a question on version spaces in the original final exam, it was clear that Q2 referred to Winston's method of incremental concept learning (and not version spaces).\n```\n- So the grading principle is, because the original problem Q3 is using version spaces, thus Q2 cannot use version spaces concept. That is indeed ridiculous as Q2 and Q3 are not related, and students taking the exam shouldn't guess which concept to use based on a question that has been deleted from the paper! *Disappointed and cannot understand what they are thinking.*",

However, a common complaint among the class is that there was a larger focus on well-made diagrams as opposed to technical writing ability. \n<br>\n<b> Exams: </b> The exams also required a large amount of writing (2k words for midterm, 3k words for final) and had ambiguous rubrics, which was frustrating because our responses were largely up to our interpretation of the problems presented. <br>\n<b> Teaching Staff: </b> The teaching staff was great! Professor Goel is pretty active on Piazza, and the head TA (Yan) was generally quick to respond to any questions we had.

What practical insight does it give you besides learning Python Pillow library to scan images and using your own software development approach to do math and compare the images, find similarity and differences. I did find any value from AI or ML perspective in this course. TA's are okay, sometimes their responses are vague, sometimes okay. They like lots of writing on out of the world scenarios. More diagrams, more flow charts and spend lot of time writing and making nice drawings. \n\nThere is a big disconnect between theory being taught and what you are expected to do in assignments. Videos are nowhere connected to assignments. overall not a very useful course if you want to utilize the knowledge in any of the practical scenario.",

That is a lot of writings but dont get me wrong, you will learn much of the concept through all of these. \n\nLectures are good and well prepared but mostly only concepts. You need to take extra steps to convert it into working code. I chose RPM project since it had more guidance and stable grading criteria. But if the chatbot assignment is improved in the future, YOU SHOULD TAKE IT! It is more valuable, used in the industry, and looks impressive in your portfolio (compared to RPM solver..). Piazza and Slack were active and really helpful.\n\nOverall a good survey course to KBAI concepts but expect to spend 20-30 hours a week for the assignments.",

With this class there is lot of writing which consume a lot of time but there is an opportunity to get your writing published if it is unique and innovative. Though there are many concepts taught in the class about AI, but it was very hard to implement the same in practical life.

The good of this course is that the professor is passionate, the TAs are active, and the course is well organized with pace and material being just challenging enough without completely pushing students over the ledge. The grading is fair and peer feedback proved to be very helpful.\n\nThe bad of this course is that the projects build upon each other with minimal help when initially trying to implement a solution. Only a half of the lecture videos are relevant to the course. There is a ton of writing and research involved in this course. \n\nNote that all of the negatives I spoke about above could also be seen as positives. This is purely dependent on the student.

I had not much prior experience but going through the required pillow library once helped a lot. Overall, a normal yet time consuming course to start the program with.

                        "body": "This is a hard one to rate. If you're looking to learn about AI, this is probably not the class you expect it to be and almost feels more like a psychology class at times. You'll be doing a ton of writing. We had three 1500-word project reflections, three 1000-word assignments, a take-home 2000-word midterm, a take-home 3000-word final, and three Peer Feedbacks to complete for each of those. Coding is limited to your 3 projects, which for most will be focused on writing a program that can solve Raven's Progressive Matrices (Java or Python with Pillow/NumPy). A small group of students was allowed to pursue Alternative Projects 2 and 3 which focused on writing a FAQ-based chatbot (Python/NLTK). The lectures were well-made, but cover very high level topics. There really isn't anything that helps you synthesize the course concepts. The RPM project only vaguely relates, depending on your approach, and the assignments and exams make it easy to cherry-pick through the lectures to get your answers, which are often somewhat subjective anyway. The course is very generously curved with anything over the class mean being an A, so it's an easy course overall. The instructor/TA interaction on Piazza is great and I was glad to see Dr Goel engaging with students at least a few times each week, even while traveling. We had a nice community going on Slack, too, which helped build camaraderie and made it fun to participate. Peer Feedbacks were very hit and miss and probably should have been scrapped entirely for the Final Exam. Peer grading didn't affect anything, but led to morale drops when getting overly-negative feedback and a lot of confusion when asked to grade another student without knowing the correct answer. Overall, it's a fine class. It's front-loaded, smoothly-run, and generally fun, but you're not likely to come out of it with many new skills that can be directly applied to anything. As with most courses, though, it's what you make of it.",

The projects were a little fun at first, but they only use the course content in a superficial way.  For me, the writing was a terrible use of time and energy.  The only thing I learned while writing for this class is how to write against the given rubric.

There is a Alt project after the first mandatory RPM project that deals with chat bot which I believe is more relevant than RPMs. Expect lots of writing in this class. I struggled with the writing assignments in the beginning but managed through later as I adjusted to the rhythm. In all there are 3 writing assignments, 3 projects with the project reflection associated with them, a mid term and a final exam. If you hate writing, this class may not be for you. Projects can use Python or Java. I would recommend brushing up your Python skills, especially Pillow and numpy for RPMs and NLTK for chat bot. This is a great first course to take and will set you up for the rest of your OMSCS journey. Good Luck!!!",

Similarly, if you struggle with the first or second project, you're in trouble because they keep building on the previous and they become harder. Many had to completely start from scratch which can be frustrating. \n\nThere's a lot of writing to be done between assignments/projects/exams and at some point it starts to feel like a lot of bsing. The class has great potential, but lacks a bit in execution.",

Those, however, became tedious towards the end of the class. It was more of the same and you don't really get any feedback from TAs on your designs. You mostly get student feedback, which I thought was often polarized and rarely educational. (I do like the student feedback aspect though - very unique. ) Going back to the project, I felt that getting a high score by any means necessary was the way to get points, then you rationalize your approach with AI language. I tried to use lesson concepts initially and got mediocre results, but I felt that I learned a lot. Then I realized I wasn't playing the same game everyone else was and adopted more productive methods, but less AI-ish, so to speak. So, in the end, I liked the class, but did not love it.",

This course is very much what you put into it. You can get a B with minimal effort, assuming you are a good programmer, or you can spend 20+ hours a week diving deeper and reviewing the optional readings. I took the course for the enjoyment of it and got a lot out of it. The final exam topic alone was so interesting that I spent several hours researching after my paper was already submitted.",

You will write ~13, 000 words throughout this course. \n\nThe projects all revolve around solving the Raven's Progressive Matrices.

There are plenty of resources out there on getting up to speed with it.

It leaves a lot in the open for you to think and go your own way. This can be frustrating for some people as students in general like hard lines as it gives us something to measure against. \n\nThere were parts of this class I didn't like, but overall it was a solid class.

I found that if you want to learn the subject, it is a much better use of your time to review the 'optional' reading. \nProject - Based on solving the RPM problems, split into 3 iterations. Students are given very little constructive feedback between iterations. Submission results in Bonnie give very little feedback as well - some students were getting timeouts, memory errors, other errors - but system returns nothing specific and TAs were not helpful on Piazza. The real complexity of this project is not KBAI - it is Computer Vision (they don't allow you to use CV libs yet it's not listed as a prerequisite)\nAssignments - I actually like writing, so these I enjoyed. It is a lot of writing, and I found that looking at the Winston book really helped me learn the concepts. At first I thought just watching lectures would be enough, but the lectures don't actually teach you anything of substance to answer these assignment questions. \nMidterm/Final - Essentially a more advanced version of the assignments. Our questions were about chatbots, and a metacognition component that could explain our RPM agent's decisions. Fun if you like writing, and they definitely chose good subjects. \n\nThe tragic thing is that this course has so much potential, as the subject matter IS interesting and all over the news. You saw the excitement at the beginning of the semester on Piazza in the active discussions. Those fizzled pretty fast. \nI do hope to improve the course offering they 1) eliminate RPM as a project and replace it with something that actually uses/teaches the kbai concepts 2) redo the lectures to actually teach the material (with proper level of detail)",

In this class, you will implement an agent to take an IQ test called the Raven's Progressive Matrices test. You will be given two sets of problems to learn from, one graded and the other not. There will be two similar sets of questions that you'll get when submitted to the autograder, here to, one graded, one not. \nThen came the writing, there is a lot of writing in this class. Three project reflections, three assignments on nothing related to the class, a midterm and a final. Totally 15, 000+ words on the minimum, and if you want to secure a good grade, at least 20, 000. \nThis not only became a drain, but a bother to complete. \nThe lectures had little to do with the class, and the depth was nonexistent. I feel that I learned little, while just enjoying the programming and creativity. \nHowever, the TAs were lenient in grading and very understanding. As a whole, we started to somewhat complain that our midterm and final essays were high level architectures with little value, so they offered an alt-final, where students could develop their midterm NLP chatbot design into a real program, I can't image many other teachers agreeing to offer a second final for students who didn't feel they were learning enough. This really shows the type of education that GT is offering, as well as this class. \nI hope they sort out the kinks in this class, it has the potential to be a great class.",

I found the projects to be pretty entertaining, and they definitely helped me hone my basic image manipulation and Python skills, but the knowledge required to solve the problems was almost completely independent of anything learned in the lectures. That being said, the lectures were fairly interesting, but they also seemed to be taught at a pretty high-level. I feel like I came out of this class with a slightly better general understanding of what they were trying to teach, but I have no idea how I would apply any of it. That being said, the production value of the lectures was great, in my opinion. They were easy to follow along with, and the little exercises kept me engaged (this is my first OMSCS class, so perhaps this is the same for the other classes as well - I don't have a comparison). \n\nThe assignments and exams were all written papers, which is fine with me. I didn't love it, but I didn't hate it either. I feel that was appropriate for the material in this course. \n\nOverall, I would recommend this course if you're interested in AI, specifically relating to human thought. The TAs and professors were exceptional (Ashok is a great instructor who clearly has a passion for this subject). However, the slighly disjointed structure of learned material vs. the application of that material left a bit to be desired. It was all very interesting content to me, but it felt a bit shallow. \n\nI selected 6 hrs/week as an estimated average. Some weeks were heavier than others, and then there were weeks when I didn't really do much at all. The course was pretty easy, in my opinion.",

I especially liked the topics of incremental concept learning, common-sense reasoning, diagnosis, and some of the videos on biology-inspired design. I also think that while writing all of those papers does get a bit old, it lets you think creatively and try to apply the topics which were learned in lectures. The experience ends up being a bit shallow since you are writing a single paper on something and then moving on, but I guess it is hard to expect more from a course that covers so many topics. The do provide a ton of extra material for you to go read on your own, and some people do that extra work and seem like they get much more out of the class if you are willing to put in the effort. \n\nA lot of the negative comments others make about this course are definitely valid. Some of the lecture material is just not deep enough, and I find myself tuning it out. This is my 6th course in the program, and I haven't had that problem very often. In addition, the three-part Ravens Matrices project gets old. I also feel like the \"no image processing experience is required\" is technically true, but I feel it would be awfully useful to have that experience. But the biggest problem with the projects is that it is hard to apply what was learned in the lectures beyond the first couple of lessons. I don't think this is specific to the problem being solved, but it is the nature of the requirements and the amount of time you have. \n\nOn a final optimistic note, I think that the alternative project 3 that was proposed is much more suitable for the course and its content. I hope they continue to have a Ravens Matrices project in the beginning of the course, but move on to the conversation agent for the second two projects. I think this would line up nicely with the ordering of lectures. \n\nIn the end I'd say I liked this class, but it was far from my favorite.",

But the overall experience is a mixed bag. There's an awful lot of high-level hand-wavy abstract AI concepts that I am certain I will never use again. On the other hand, there very challenging projects solving these Raven's Progressive Matrices that you may, barely, use one hundredth of one of the course concepts but probably will just use math. It's a great course, but I wish it were more filling. \n\nLots of essays. If you can write well, you will dominate this course. New for Fall 2016 is an optional alternative final project based on the Alexa challenge -- the kind of innovations the professor brings to the course. I just wish the level of the course were more relevant to... life?",

With one month to go, I do not think I would recommend this course over other courses which have deeper roots in math. The lectures are full of high level concepts and the ideas seem very familiar. It feels like a lot of the material is stuff that most students should already know, but with new terminology. \n\nThe Ravens project was interesting for the first and second iteration. Doing the verbal approach in the first felt like a direct application of the earlier AI concepts. Attempting the visual approach for the second felt less so. I have not started on the third part, but I have ideas on what to implement at this point, and it might not be based on any of the concepts in this course. There are some students that will be creating an AI chatbot for their third project, and they may find more success in using the material from this course. It feels like the Ravens agent does not have a feedback loop to improve itself and is therefore lacking in the learning portion of an AI agent. \n\nThere is a bit of writing required for this course. The reflection papers that are required with each project submission are not so bad, since the students write about what they implemented and relate it back to the class topics. The stand alone assignments were slightly aggravating, because you talk about the general topics and how they could potentially be used to solve difficult problems. The mid-term felt the same. It was difficult to judge how in depth to go into the problems. And it was also tough to know if the solutions were implementable. It would have been nice to do smaller coding assignments and write on those experiences. Although, I may be in the minority with this feeling, because from the peer feedback system I came across a number of nice papers filled with figures and well thought out solutions.",

The content that is there uses trivial examples, with significant hand-waving (ignore the man behind the curtain) of anything that would require them to actually have detail. \n\nThe course projects (building a program that can solve Ravens Progressive Matrices) which make up the majority of your grade have absolutely nothing to do with the course material. \n\nTIP: Use the two methods from Agent 3 in this paper to do you projects if you take the class, you'll save yourself a ton of headaches. \nhttp://www. davidjoyner. net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/JoynerBedwellGrahamLemmonMartinezGoel-ICCC2015-Distribution. pdf\n\nThe various papers (3 1000 word assignments, 3 1500 word project reflections, a 2000 word midterm, and a 3000 word final) will consume most of your time.

This isn't necessarily great if the objective is learning about the concepts, and it isn't necessarily fair for those less hacky of us, either. However, Joyner is a champion, and he made this course a joy. TA's are very involved on Piazza and there were a lot of interesting discussions going on.

The project is interesting and has great flexibilities to try out many different things. If you decided to implement a few killer solutions, it's also easy to get by and get good grades.

Heck, I haven't written so much as I did in when I got my undergraduate's degree. 2) We don't get to implement more of the concepts we learn and are stuck working with similar material for all three projects. 3) Grading seems to be inconsistent with graders and many times they don't provide feedback about why they knocked points off. I did, however, enjoy the professor and TA's enthusiasm to respond to our questions and provide statistics to graded work and that sort of thing. I also was happy to see many individuals participating in the Piazza forums, creating interesting discussions about KBAI in general. I'd recommend this course to be taken in the beginning of your OMSCS journey since it is a very smoothly run course (there were some hiccups, but nothing big), and you get to practice your java or python skills!",

Main reasons being: \n1. Lectures give interesting overview but they lack the depth compared to other courses that I took in previous semesters. \n2. In project work, visual approach is mandatory by the end and it involves mostly ad-hoc heuristics for RPM problems rather than any widely applicable AI algorithms. So you don't get hands on practice of learnt concepts. However, in textual approach I was able to implement some general technique based on learnt concepts, avoiding most hard coding or ad-hoc heuristics. \n3. Assignments are just essays about possible applications of techniques. So you again lack hands-on exposure. \nWith 3 projects (with reflection write-up), assignments and peer feedback, it felt more like busy work.",

Perhaps the suggested readings were intended to supply the depth, but I didn't find them necessary for success in the course.

                        "body": "This is my second OMSCS course. This course focuses on the process of human cognition and methodologies to design artificial intelligence to imitate human cognition. This course addressing the topic of artificial intelligence from a methodological standpoint rather than discussing the algorithms and frameworks for implementations. It is important to set your expectation straight before jumping into this course. David Joyner is an exceptionally good teacher. GATech is lucky to have him. \n\nThough solving the Raven's Progressive Matrices in course project is fun, I have to say this course is pedagogically flawed. First, in the project work, you never really got the opportunity to implement the learnt methods. The problems are getting more and more difficult as the course progress, the absolute majority of the course participates (including myself) has to code more and more complex and specific rule sets, which is tedious and boring. Instead of solving more complex problems, I would be happier to stay with simpler ones but try more advanced methods, e. g. , learning by correcting mistakes, version space, to build my agent with learning capabilities. There are reviews saying you do not have to watch the course video to be able to work with the project, which is true to some extent. Second, the assignments are the worst part of the course. For example, you are asked to design a self-driving agent using one of the method discussed in the lecture in 1000 words and one of the grading rubric is on the feasibility of the proposed solution. Self-driving car is not even in mass production, how can we describe a feasible proposal in 1000 words? The most funny part is the TA's feedback, which goes like: How well does the assignment describe the problem it is attempting to solve?: 5 \u2026. Though I got really good grades, I am very sure that I learned nothing from the assignments. I was really close to quit this course after reading the TA's feedback to my first assignment.",

If you are into AI or agents or even the cognitive process then you'll enjoy this class. The lectures gave great examples and were easy to follow. You really didn't have to read much outside of watching the lectures. \n\nI struggled a bit with their system for turning in projects, but once I got it solved it was a non-issue.

The course is not hard and you can make it fun but it is up to you. \nThe lectures are mere overview of the topics, my undergrad AI course gave me much deeper knowledge on AI. You're on your own discovering the topics; lots of readings are presented so you can dig deeper if you'd like. Which is nice. But I would go as far as don't even waste your time watching lectures if the title sounds familiar to you - for example there is a lecture on classification but it does not go into any mathematical or implementation detail whatsoever. If you've taken an AI, ML or CV class before (or you've read a few pages on wikipedia about statistical classification), you already know more than it is presented in the class. \nWritten assignment are fine, they are short and as the class doesn't, neither are you required to go into technical details. The grading of the papers is a bit of a lottery, depends a lot on the reviewer. I got points taken away for totally contradicting reasons between two assignments. \nThe coding homework is fun but barely has anything to do with the class materials. Turns out you better off implementing stuff on your own (hardcoding lots of stuff) and later claim that this for cycle is 'learning by recording cases' and those if conditionals are 'decision trees' or whatever. \nSo all in all interesting ideas are presented, coding can be fun (but time consuming if you're not good at Python), the papers are not hard and grading is generous but there is no connection between these. Requirements are not always clear and you never really know where you at performance-wise which caused frustration for some. You can easily get a B or A in this class with very small effort - papers can be done in an hour or two, you can skim through videos quickly and the 3 programming assignments can be done during a weekend. Rest of it is up to you.",

I have no ML or AI background, given that I found the lectures very informative, some students in the class who had taken ML didn't like the contents much! The lectures make the concepts look very easy because they use very simple daily life example but when you want to write the assignment on a useful AI problem, it is very very tough!! The projects are solving RPM puzzles; while it was enjoyable and rewarding to write python programs that solve complex visual analogy puzzles, I felt let down that I couldn't use any of the AI concepts that we learnt in them. At the end of each video David Joyner does gives tips on how the techniques could be used in RPM puzzle but even then it was difficult applying them. Videos talk a lot about learning and reasoning but we were given no guidance on how to write such a program. From Spring 2016, the course work is cut down a bit, we only had 3 assignments, 3 projects, 1 midterm and 1 final. We get 3 weeks for doing the project and 1 week for assignments. Midterm and final are both open ended and open book and are given 1 week each. I have given 15 hours/week but I think you can do with 10 hours/week if you are very goal oriented and super focused unlike me.

In the end, I had a sense of what the TAs look for (though it's hit-or-miss depending on who you get), and I wrote to that. Beware if you have a different thought than what's accepted!\nThe word count in the assignments is a lie. You need to double or triple it, add about six or seven diagrams and probably some pseudo-code. I got burned on the first reflection because it was too short and I didn't understand what they were looking for. \nThe class was hard because in a sense, the ideas were too simple. I didn't feel like I was learning anything and so I didn't even know what I could write about. \nI didn't like Dr. Goel. He didn't seem respectful of the fact that I was having difficulty understanding what the requirements were. I felt like I was guessing, and he would just disagree when I attempted an idea (but not give me any clues as to how to continue). It seemed lazy, like he didn't actually want to think about my problem--but then, why even respond?\nThe TAs were fine, and helped me out with some of the issues I had. Their feedback on my assignments was insufficient, but they actually helped me with some of my questions and seemed to care about how well my Raven's solutions were going. \nIn the end, I was disappointed and I think I may have wasted four months banging my head against the wall, trying to find meaning in a class that just doesn't have any.",

I did not get the pleasure of having David as the TA but I hear he is equally amazing. Dr. Goel makes this an extraordinary class and really keeps one engaged. The head TA we had, Lallith, did a great job as well. There are numerous positives and I want list them all here other than to say that the positives way out weight the negatives. But will here are my two negatives. \nOne, the third project emphasizes the use of visual viewing of the images which you end up focusing on solving the problem visually instead of utilizing any AI techniques you learned in the class. People with a visual programming background have an advantage on project 3 I think. Note it shouldn't affect your grade to much just feel I spent way more time trying to understand visual programming then I did learning to apply AI techniques on project 3. \nTwo, there is alot of writing and essays. Some of the essay questions become fairly hard to apply using the items you learned in class. Alot of the AI techniques overlap and are fairly theoretical. On top of this, it is graded by a random TA. There is no secondary grader and your scores are left to the arbitrary TA who reviews it. On top of this I had in some cases great detail about why I was scored a certain way and then in others it was a single sentence. There is alot of writing and it spreads the TAs pretty thin but would be nice if a second pair of TA eyes could review a paper. Note, I am not complaining of my score they did a pretty good job but just seems a bit arbitrary. \nThe work load is pretty high and can be made higher depending how much detail you want to give. The instructor is down right amazing and enjoys challenging the students and himself. Overall I highly recommend the class and most will do fine as long as real effort is made. Grade is curved.",

They are very engaged, obviously passionate about the class, and ran a very smooth ship. But, this class was too much fluff for my taste. I remember when I was in undergrad, there were different versions of physics classes of varying difficulty for different majors. The easiest version was for humanity majors, which was mostly high-level and conceptual, and was dubbed \"physics for poets\". I felt this class was \"AI for poets\". But, it seems a lot of students don't share my sentiment and loved this class. I suspect those from a more math heavy background might find this class boring. \n\nThe class is pretty easy and is a good candidate to pair with a harder class. Because there is a good deal of writing, I suspsect students who don't speak English as a first language may struggle a little more with this aspect."

The assignments are thought provoking, and the project is an absolute blast. \n\nI disagree with what others have to say about needing to be a \"python expert\". I program in. NET at my day job, and found the jump to be fairly easy. It absolutely helps if you're a strong programmer, however. If you're not, what are you doing in a masters computer science course anyways?\n\nA minor critique about the class - maybe less writing assignments, and more programming assignments. Often throughout the class I wished I was given time to implement some of the ideas you write about. Also, the project is amazing, but I think they need to reexamine their policy on what external libraries you can use. I've felt like the project is more a visual processing assignment than an AI one.",

Overall, I left the class without any confidence that I could actually apply anything outside of the class. The written assignments were worthless because the feedback was trivial, the readings were overwhelming, and the project was neat but ultimately felt pointless because the code was basically a one-off script that wouldn't have much value to any other problem domain.

I would rate the lectures and papers A+, moderately challenging while extremely interesting and informative, ie. the perfect class in my opinion. \n\nThe only thing I didn't love about the class is the project. You're given a single challenge and then three attempts to build an AI agent that can handle it. It's the same problem (taking a visual IQ test) each time, but the difficulty is increased as time goes on. \n\nThe first version of the project was interesting and pretty fun. But by the second time I was getting a little tired of it, and now I'm working on v3 and I'm not so excited about it. \n\nThe reason is, I feel the project has devolved into a test of my image processing skills rather than an test of knowledge-based AI programming. I didn't mind that on a single project, but I wish we'd gotten to try something different for p2 and p3 instead of the same thing just harder. \n\nHowever, in the scheme of things, the project isn't too bad and the class remains really fun. The Piazza forum is extremely active, and Dr. Goel is highly responsive and engaging with the students. \n\nThis was my first class in OMSCS and I thoroughly enjoyed it.

While this is not a class in development practices, I'd like to see some enforced in the work the instructor touts as an example other students should follow.",

To illustrate the volume, the word count heuristics from the teaching team led to about 15k words in total across all the assignments. I recommend front loading and starting with a strong, steady pace early in the semester. \n\nThe work included a mix of written assignments, code/applied projects, project write ups, exams, and peer feedback. This mixture resulted in a nice balance to the grading, with no one assignment making up the bulk of the course grade. The balance of broad topical coverage with more deep dives in the assignments was also good. \n\nThe teaching team was really great, and the feedback and grades on assignments were returned in a very timely manner. Piazza provided plenty of interesting reading and interaction for those so inclined, from both the teaching team and the students.

This class taught me about data structures other than the standard collections, arrays, b-tree and linked-list methods for storing and cataloging information. Prof. Goel and David Joiner are exceptional instructors and the material is well presented. The TAs were also very good and active in the Piazza forums. The only negatives are the assignments and projects got to be a little boring because even though you are using different methodologies, you are still solving the same problems over and over throughout the semester. Also, there is a lot of material so the class moves at a quick pace. I would have liked to posted more in the forums but time was a bit of a constraint. I did read a lot of the posts and most were insightful - Piazza definitely adds to the class experience. I highly recommend this class - you will definitely think differently about A. I. and data representations after taking this course.",

There is a writing assignment almost every week and it regurgitates the same topic for some. When you're not writing you're working on your project. Oh, you also have a write up for that. Don't believe if anyone says that you only need to do the minimum amount for the papers. The students that are held in high regard for assignments turn in 2x to 3x what is required and everyone else is held to that standard. Th project is ongoing and does not really offer any opportunity to develop meaningful AI algorithms that you learn in class. There is hardly anytime to write a great AI agent because you spend so much time writing. That's what I really couldn't stand about the class, too much talking about theory and not enough time spent on actually implementing the ideas. I'm sure there are students that will argue my experience, but I want to actually program to see what they are talking about actually works in the real world. I felt the lectures were too high level and the examples were at the grade school level. So it was really difficult to find value in the lectures. This is not a critique against the professor and the TA's they are great! It just that the material could have been presented better. If you're looking to learn some cool AI techniques, you're not going to find them here. This class is really an intro to cognitive AI, nothing more. It is broad sweeping with no real substance.",

I took it in the Summer Semester and it was definitely 'jam packed', requiring my full-time attention. I would recommend the class during either the normal Fall or Winter schedules, but not during the reduced timeframe Summer schedule. My '30 hours per week' would probably be less had the course been spread over the normal amount of time. \n\nI would seriously recommend either taking the CP or CV class before taking this class or have a decent amount of experience using Python's PIL image module. Without this background, you'll be at a disadvantage with the projects. I spent a lot of time learning image processing and went down a lot of dead-ends on my projects because I wasn't prepared for the visual processing aspect of the projects. IMHO, taking CP or CV should be a prerequisite of the class, or at least strongly encouraged. \n\nDavid Joyner is an excellent and enthusiastic teacher, unlike some in this program who seem totally 'checked-out'.

You are designing an agent which you work on throughout the semester. My advice is keep it simple. I would say it is a survey course in that you get an overview of lots of techniques and can choose what you want to do for your agent. Also, on the weeks that a midterm or a project isn't due, you have to write mini papers on how you would apply one of the many techniques to the project. Just be sure to keep up with lectures the best you can, stay involved in the class and don't procrastinate. In the early weeks, I think I spent more time on my agent just because I was a bit unsure but there have been weeks that I spent 5 hours on the class. Some of the lectures are an hour long so I'd dedicate at least 10 hours/week to the class, preferably closer to 15 just in case.",

There was more writing in this class than I have had in other classes, but its been okay. The projects are open-ended and you can spend as much time as you want on them. I usually got my projects to a point where I could turn them and get a decent grade very quickly, but then spend a lot of time improving them afterwards to try to solve more problems.

It's pretty flexible because you will learn more topics than what you can write essays for, so it's flexible given that you choose what topic to write on, the essay helps you develop your understanding of the topic. \nThen, every 3 weeks you write an agent (java or python) that actually solves the problem, you can code it however you want it. \nThe midterm was take home, you are given a whole week to complete it, but it can be done in less than a day. \nThere's lots of paths to be taken to further explore what is being learned bu that's up to your motivation and availability. \nAll projects are solo.",

You learn how to write a program that models human intelligence. You learn many different concepts of knowledge representation, problem solving, and machine learning. In the first project, you learn how to write a program to solve basic IQ test style questions. However, there are 4 projects in the class, and each project is just the same project, just with harder IQ questions. Grading is completely results based (how many did it solve?), so in the interest of solving as many problems as I could, I have not delved deep into the advanced concepts that we have learned in lecture, because if you're even somewhat busy, you're just going to apply the concepts that will solve the most problems in the least amount of time it takes to write (instead of spending the time to apply as many concepts as it takes to solve all the problems). I would much rather have the class have slightly smaller projects that are different each time (like the problems covered in the lectures are way more interesting to me) more specialized toward a concept that forces you to apply new concepts. Another problem I have with this class is the sheer amount of writing we have to do. I've never taken an engineering class where we literally have to write a paper every week. The amount of writing isn't much, but as someone who has gotten used to writing only for project reports, it really sucks.",

It also means that you get great feedback through the peer review system, and timely assignment grades (which was a problem in my other course). They work to stagger due dates and they publish all due dates at or near the beginning of the term (in the initial syllabus, in fact), which makes it possible for you to plan well if you have other classes or major work commitments. \nIn terms of learning, you get out of the class more or less what you put into it. I didn't have time to implement the number of alternative algorithms I really wanted to on the projects (particularly the later ones), but that wasn't necessary to get a decent grade. \nIn terms of the subject matter, I loved what the course covered, but I am biased since AI is my area of particular interest. I felt that coding the agent was fun but that students without some prior exposure to image processing datastructures were at a disadvantage. \nYou will find this class easy if you: are efficient and good at expressing ideas in writing, are fluent at coding in Java or Python, and have sat in on an image processing course at some point in time (it's fine if you think you've forgotten everything). \nIf one of those doesn't hold true for you, expect to put in a bit more time than my estimate.",

However, I'm less excited about its content than some other reviewers. The class takes you through a ton of interesting topics but doesn't delve deep into them at all. I thought the projects and/or assignments would account for that but there was little connection between the projects and the course material. In fact, if you try to apply many of the lecture concepts to your agent you'll likely spend more time than other students and up with an underperforming agent because they simply aren't a good fit. The projects are fun in of themselves if a bit repetitive. A poll was taken on how much time students spent on the first project and it spanned from 10-50+ hours, with the mean seemingly somewhere in the 20s. It seems that students with deeper algorithmic programming experience found the projects pretty easy, while others struggled monumentally. The assignments are just written essays that involve describing/applying a given technique, kind of like thought exercises, without actually building anything and therefore resulting in a ton of wiggle room. Long story short: I don't feel like I learned much in this course, esp. considering the time commitment.",

The teaching is the best I've seen in the OMCSC program by leaps and bounds - mostly because of the professor/instructor combo of Ashok Goel and David Joyner. One neat thing they do in this class is list and save exceptional submissions. Unlike the above comment, I thought this was a good introductory course for a broad amount of material. I enjoy writing assignments, so I didn't mind that particular aspect of the course. Make sure you know Java or Python (2 or 3) a bit, the projects are intense though have a forgiving curve.",

I'd venture that you could put in much less work and still do well. The programming projects are interesting, but become repetitive. As alluded to above, if you have some algorithmic development under your belt, you can do better than average without even thinking about a KBAI algorithm. There was a *ton* of writing for the class. I think I will hit 80 pages of turned in essays/design reports/exams. This semester there were 5 1000 word essays, 4 1500 word design reports, and 2 ~2500 word exams. However, I think you'd be hard pressed to cover the questions in the depth required by the rubric at those lengths; I was usually at least double the suggested length. Mostly these assignments are rehashing lecture material at a high level. I think this course would have been much better had they selected 3-4 topics and gone in depth on each with a tailored project.",

I was enormously impressed by the responsive and productive communication between everyone, instructors and students alike.

If you attempt to implement using one of the more advanced techniques, you will likely get a little discouraged on the actual result. Therefore, most people stayed with brute force algorithmatic approach. Warning, if you never had image processing related experience, the visual compoenent will be more involved!

You need to be comfortable with either Java or Python to complete the programming projects of which there are four. The final one involves some computer vision/image processing work so be prepared to learn about it on your own if you haven't done such work before. There is also a lot of writing required; eight written assignments, two exams and each programming project has to be accompanied by a design report. The quality of teaching and the TA support was excellent. The workload was substantial but ultimately manageable. Make sufficient time to watch and study the lectures which cover the topics in the text BOOK (AI by Patrick Winston) extensively. Some people took this course together with another one but I wouldn't recommend doing that unless you are able to study full-time. If you start your programming assignments early, you should be able to do well in this course. \n\nTo counter the negative points made elsewhere on this page about having to write an essay every week, I would say that yes there is some writing involved but it's not really that much since they only ask for about 500 words per essay. The purpose of the essays is to give you a chance to think through how you will apply a specific AI technique to the programming assignments and dry-run your ideas in your mind before you start coding.",

I'll list the pros and cons:\n\nPros:\n1. Excellent TA and instructors, obviously cared about the class, very very involved in Piazza, and excellent to talk to. \n2. Easy A. Projects are not that hard if you're confident in programming, and are really easy in terms of grading. Last two projects had means in the 60s(which is also the threshold for an A), and I ended with grades in the high 80s with a couple of hours of effort. \n\nCons:\n1. Way too many things. I don't really understand why you need 4 projects, 5 assignments, a midterm and a final?? Oh wait and also peer feedback/participation. I spent way too much time on this class for nowhere close to enough gain. \n2. Grading is a joke. \n a. Project grading is virtually completely based on how many problems your agent solves, which de-incentivzes you to try anything creative. \n b. Assignment/midterm/final grading is absurd. I did well on them all, but it seems to completely arbitrary. I would get a below mean grade on an assignment with a comment 'Good job', or points docked off with no explanation, or a really good score on an obviously half-assed assignment. \n3. Peer feedback is quite useless. Started off well for maybe one assignment, after which point it became obvious that people were just doing it to get your participation grade, and not really reading the assignments. Not to mention they made it compulsory to do peer feedback for assignments that you didn't even attempt. \n4. Content is useless. Ah, this was my biggest gripe with this course. The material taught in the class did not seem practical at all. Maybe I'm amazingly misunderstanding the course material, but it seems to be mostly common sense that they somehow manage to come up with more and more terminology for. And I don't mean trying to understand how common sense works, no, I mean the concepts that they understand seemed hardly worthy of a class. If you look at any practical AI, it's machine learning and mathematical approaches. I think I learned absolutely nothing in this class. \n5. Projects are unrelated to course content. I got excellent grades on all the projects, but I saw basically no relation to the content taught in the class. I would have done equally well had I not watched a single video(except for the project report, where I had to shoehorn concepts to the actual project)",

Regarding the project work, I like the approach as it seems reflective of what you would do if developing a 'real world' agent. I think going from relatively easy to more difficult problems helps to apply additional concepts to solve them and build on the past. \nThis is my 3rd course in the program and ranks as my favorite, in a pretty tight race.",

The projects are little hard to start with but you get to see exemplary projects after each submission and that will help you improve your scripts. The instructors and TA are very helpful. There is a lot of communication between students and teachers which keeps you engaged in the class. There are open discusssions on assignments and projects without giving away any answers and the staff encourages that a lot.

Very abstract and it was hard for me to go into details. The video lectures are interesting but very high level. I would have liked to see greater depth. The projects was where it was at as it was the most enjoyable (and most time consuming). You can write your programs in either Java or Python. Go with Python, even if you have zero experience in Python and lots of experience in Java. Python is an easy language to pick up and the image manipulation library you have access to blows Java out of the water. Extremely fun class, even if its a lot of work. Highly recommend",

You get a choice between a visual (image processing) and a verbal (hashlike input processing) agent for the first two projects. If I could do it again, I'd do the projects visually from the get-go. Visual isn't much harder, is way more fun and less annoying, saves you from redoing things later and gives you more time to fine-tune your agent. Also, if it's all the same to you, between Java and Python, pick Python. Those guys seem to get way more useful library methods for image processing than the Java camp.",

The projects are open-ended in that you can use any methods you want for them, and the concepts taught in the course are meant to give you ideas to try implementing on your own. There are also assignments in the form of short papers explaining how you might apply a concept from the course to the projects, and take-home exams that similarly require exploring the concepts in-depth. Overall the instructors seem to really care about designing the course to give students the best learning experience possible and encourage creativity. You do not need to have any previous AI experience to take this course, and it's not very math-heavy compared to other AI courses I have taken. You will also have a much easier time on the projects if you are proficient in writing Python or Java code, a lot of the project involves coming up with and trying your own ideas for algorithms so being able to implement a new idea quickly is helpful. If you do end up having a hard time on the projects, the minimum performance for getting a decent grade is very reasonable. Overall if you like thinking creatively, want to study how machines and humans can approach reasoning and enjoy working on projects this is a great course.",

It's the best executed/managed class so far in my 3rd semester in this program. The teaching is great in conveying difficult concepts into practical examples. Like many already stated, the TA (David Joyner) is amazing. Highly recommended course!",
