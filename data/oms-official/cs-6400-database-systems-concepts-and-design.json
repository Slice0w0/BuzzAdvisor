    "Overview": "We believe in learning-by-example and learning-by-doing. This course presents an example of applying a database application development methodology to a major real-world project. All the database concepts, techniques, and tools that are needed to develop a database application from scratch are introduced along the way when they are needed. In parallel - slightly delayed - learners in the course will apply the database application development methodology, techniques, and tools to their own major class team project. Students will also learn the Extended Entity Relationship Model, the Relational Model, Relational algebra, calculus and SQL, database normalization, efficiency, and indexing. Finally, techniques and tools for metadata management and archival will be presented.",
