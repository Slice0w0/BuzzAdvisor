Before Taking This Class...
Suggested Background Knowledge
Students must have a basic computer science background and be proficient in modern programming languages. Most of the tools utilized in the course are Java or Python based, with one lab working in TypeScript using React. All lab code is simplified and does not require advanced knowledge in one particular programming language, with the focus on the healthcare applications and data standards. Labs and tools may utilize Docker for deployment, though advance knowledge is not required. Team projects can vary significantly, with students often allowed to work in their strengths or learn new libraries/frameworks (e.g., React, Angular, Python APIs, etc.). While not required, familiarity with web application deployment may be beneficial for projects. No previous knowledge of health informatics is required. Any student qualified enough to be admitted to OMSCS—and willing to put in the necessary time for course work—should be prepared for this course.
Major Languages and Tools: Java, Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, React, Docker
