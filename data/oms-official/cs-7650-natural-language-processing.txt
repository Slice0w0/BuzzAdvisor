Course Goals
Natural language processing (NLP) seeks to endow computers with the ability to intelligently process human language. NLP components are used in conversational agents and other systems that engage in dialogue with humans, automatic translation between human languages, automatic answering of questions using large text collections, the extraction of structured information from text, tools that help human authors, and many, many more. This course will teach you the fundamental ideas used in key NLP components as well as current state-of-the-art practice in developing NLP algorithms.
By the end of the course students should:
Be able to implement a variety of commonly used algorithms for natural language text processing including statistical approaches and neural network approaches. 
Be able to implement solutions to common natural language text processing problems including text classification, text generation, dialogue, language translation, and document retrieval. 
Be able to analyze the statistical properties of text documents. 
Understand the significance of different algorithms, why they were developed, and when they should be used.
