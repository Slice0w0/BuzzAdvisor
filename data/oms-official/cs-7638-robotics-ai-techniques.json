    "course-name": "cs-7638-robotics-ai-techniques",
    "foundational": true,
    "admin": "CS",
    "Overview": "Students will be expected to complete six problem sets and multiple projects that apply the methods learned in this class.",
    "Course Goals": "Upon successfully completing this course, you will be able to:\n- Implement filters (including histogram, Kalman, and particle filters) in order to localize moving objects whose locations are subject to noise.\n- Implement search algorithms (including Dijkstra's, A*, and Value Iteration) to plan the shortest path from one point to another subject to costs on different types of movement.\n- Implement PID controls to smoothly correct an autonomous robot’s course.\n- Implement path smoothing algorithms to reduce the jaggedness of a robot's path.\n- Implement a SLAM algorithm for a robot moving in at least two dimensions.",
    "Course Overview": "",
    "Sample Lesson": "",
    "Sample Syllabi": "Note: Sample syllabi are provided for informational purposes only. For the most up-to-date information, consult the official course documentation.",
    "Course Videos": "You can view the lecture videos for this coursehere.",
    "Suggested Background Knowledge": "You should be able to navigate the command line (terminal) and execute Python scripts. Students should know Python:\n- Working knowledge of Python (built-in data types, declaring/invoking functions/classes, OOP, loop constructs, conditional statements, exception handling, basic debugging skills, understand stack traces and use them to fix code)\n- If you don't have working knowledge of Python, then you should be proficient in another language and be able to learn Python quickly and autonomously (this course assumes you know Python from the start)\n- Check out Georgia Tech'sIntroduction to Python Programmingprofessional certificate program on edX if you'd like to get up to speed beforehand.",
    "Technical Requirements and Software": "\n- Browser and connection speed: An up-to-date version of the Chrome browser with Honorlock extension is required for taking exams. We support Mozilla Firefox or Microsoft Edge for all other activities. 2+ Mbps connection speed is recommended.\n- Python (version 3.10 or higher) development environment\n- Operating system:PC: Windows 10 with latest updates installedMac: OS X 10.14 or higher with latest updates installedLinux: any recent distribution that has the supported browsers installed (may need access to Windows/Mac for Honorlock extension on exams)\n- PC: Windows 10 with latest updates installed\n- Mac: OS X 10.14 or higher with latest updates installed\n- Linux: any recent distribution that has the supported browsers installed (may need access to Windows/Mac for Honorlock extension on exams)",
    "Academic Integrity": "All Georgia Tech students are expected to uphold theGeorgia Tech Academic Honor Code. This course may impose additional academic integrity stipulations; consult the official course documentation for more information."
