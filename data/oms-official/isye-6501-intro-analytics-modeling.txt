Course Goals
The most important thing you can learn from this course is not the memorization of any specific bit of material. Instead, I would like you to learn these skills:
Given a business (or other) question, select an appropriate analytics model to answer it, specify the data you will need to solve it, and understand what the model’s solution will and will not provide as an answer.
Given someone else’s use of analytics to address a specific business (or other) question, evaluate whether they have used an appropriate model (and appropriate data) and whether their conclusion is reasonable.

Another goal of this course is for you to learn how to think though descriptions and usage of new models, so you can continue to learn throughout your career. New techniques will certainly be developed after you graduate, and we want you to be able to pick them up quickly.
We will not cover the mathematics and algorithms under the hood, or deeper mastery of the modeling needed to set up the use of the technique. You can acquire those deeper levels of knowledge in elective courses. (In fact, we could spend an entire semester on many of the topics you’ll see in the course.)
