    "Overview": "Cognitive science is an interdisciplinary study of mind and intelligence lying at the intersection of artificial intelligence, psychology, neurobiology, education, linguistics, anthropology, and philosophy. In this course, students are introduced to the basic concepts, hypotheses, models, methods, issues, and debates in cognitive science. The course will cover the main information-processing paradigms in cognitive science as well as the main critiques of the paradigms. The knowledge and understanding acquired through this course will inform students' subsequent work in human-centered computing, information system design, digital media, educational technology, design computing, human-robot reaction, and more.",
    "Course Goals": "Specific objectives include:\n- Introduction to the main information-processing paradigms in cognitive science as well as the main critiques of the paradigms,\n- Introduction to the central questions, topics, themes, and perspectives that drive the study of cognitive science, including their historical development,\n- Understanding the variety of methodologies used to explore cognitive science, including the capabilities and limitations of different research methods, and\n- Learning about the relationship between cognitive science and computing, including human-centered computing, robotics, design, and educational technology.",
    "Sample Syllabus": "Note: Sample syllabi are provided for informational purposes only. For the most up-to-date information, consult the official course documentation.",
    "Suggested Background Knowledge": "In this class, you will:\n- Understand and participate in scholarly conversations on cognitive science.\n- Read and understand cognitive science papers.\n- Analyze and address problems in computing from a cognitive science perspective, especially in human-centered computing, information system design, educational technology, design informatics, human-robot interaction, etc.\n- Use an interactive modeling tool to construct a model of a complex ecological system and reflect on how scientific knowledge and discoveries are made.\n- Build a computational “proof-of-concept” system for a proposed task and critique the model from the perspective of cognitive science.",
    "Technical Requirements and Software": "Operating system:\n- PC: Windows XP or higher with latest updates installed\n- Mac: OS X 10.6 or higher with latest updates installed\n- Linux: any recent distribution that has the supported browsers installed",
    "Academic Integrity": "All Georgia Tech students are expected to uphold theGeorgia Tech Academic Honor Code. This course may impose additional academic integrity stipulations; consult the official course documentation for more information."
