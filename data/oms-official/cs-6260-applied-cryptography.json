    "foundational": true,
    "admin": "C",
    "Overview": "A graduate-level introduction to modern cryptography, which focuses on the classical goals of cryptography, such as data privacy, authenticity and integrity.",
    "Course Goals": "You will learn various cryptographic schemes and how they are used in practice. For example, you will learn what AES, CBC, RSA, DSA, TLS stand for and how they \"work\". But the main objectives are more fundamental. The goals are to build the understanding of what \"secure\" is and how to evaluate and measure security. You will also learn how to compare security of various schemes, and how to select parameters to achieve required security guarantees. Note that you will not be learning the internal details of block ciphers or how to build/implement them.",

    "Before Taking This Class...": "No previous knowledge of cryptography is necessary. This course is about applying theory to practical problems, but it is still a theory course. The main requirement is basic \"mathematical maturity\". You have to be able to read and write mathematical definitions, statements and proofs.",
    "Suggested Background Knowledge": "No previous knowledge of cryptography is necessary. This course is about applying theory to practical problems, but it is still a theory course. The main requirement is basic \"mathematical maturity\". You have to be able to read and write mathematical definitions, statements and proofs.",
    "Academic Integrity": "All Georgia Tech students are expected to uphold theGeorgia Tech Academic Honor Code. This course may impose additional academic integrity stipulations; consult the official course documentation for more information."
