Overview
An understanding of certain aspects of the law can help computer scientists contribute more to their enterprise. We will learn about the various types of law that computer scientists may encounter. Students will be exposed to the US legal system, intellectual property, licensing and contracts, and data privacy. In what we believe to be the first of its kind in a computer law course, students will analyze third-party commercial-grade code as a technical expert (witness) might do to support a litigation. At the end of the course, students should be aware of basic legal issues in the computer field and understand when they need advice from a lawyer.
This course is not foundational and does not count toward any specializations at present, but it can be counted as a free elective.
