    "Overview": "Abuse of big data means your worst fears can come true. Being monitored by your employer? Check. Government intrusions into your daily life? Check. Being turned down by college admissions because you are predicted to not donate in 10-20 years? Check. Sounds a bit like the visions in the Minority Report? Alas, machine learning algorithms are already being deployed by industry, government, and yes, even schools to make decisions that impact us in direct ways. Such programs are typically promoted as fair and free of human biases; but humans, humans that make mistakes, are programming, calibrating, and evaluating their performance. Thus resides the problem. How do we therefore design algorithms that effectively deal with the large amounts of data that are used to train them, while ensuring their outcomes aren't, well, misused. In this course, not only will we examine various AI/ML techniques that can be used to counterbalance the potential abuse and misuse of learning from big data, but we will focus on the effects of these technologies on individuals, organizations, and society, paying close attention to what our responsibilities are as computing professionals.",
    "Course Goals": "In this class, you will be challenged to broaden your understanding of state-of-the-art AI/ML algorithms and solutions; considering the potential impacts they may have on society. You will have ample opportunity to critically analyze various situations and viewpoints provided in papers, books, on the web, and from your own observations. You will be able to practice your learned knowledge by writing coherent and well- structured critiques of situations and papers, leading and participating in class discussions, and designing your own algorithmic solutions. The issue of data misuse and abuse is not easily solvable; concrete right or wrong answers are not easily determined until after solutions are typically deployed into society. In view of this, you are entitled to your opinions on any topics presented throughout the course, whatever they happen to be. You will not be penalized for your viewpoints; however, you must be able to support your viewpoints and resulting solutions effectively. This means showing that you have actually given your approach to a problem some thought, can discuss its various trade-offs and implications, and can be supportive of other viewpoints, even though your personal views may be different.",
