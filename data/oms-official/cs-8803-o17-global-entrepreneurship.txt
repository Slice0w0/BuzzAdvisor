Overview
This course will provide you with real-world, hands-on learning on what it’s like to create a startup. You will learn the language and values of entrepreneurship, and then work to hone your entrepreneurial skills.
This course is not about how to write a business plan, nor is it an exercise on how smart you are in a classroom, or how well you do research. Instead, it is a laboratory: you will be getting your hands dirty talking to customers, partners, competitors, as you encounter the chaos and uncertainty of how a startup actually works. It is possible that you may create a startup you wish to pursue.
You will learn how to turn a good idea into a great company. You’ll learn how to use a business model to brainstorm each part of a company and the customer development process to get out of the classroom to see whether anyone other than you would want/use your product. You'll participate in these discovery activities. Finally, you’ll see how agile development can help you rapidly iterate your product to build something customers will use and buy.
Your startup can be about anything you wish. You're the founder, after all!
This course is not foundational and does not count toward any specializations at present, but it can be counted as a free elective.
