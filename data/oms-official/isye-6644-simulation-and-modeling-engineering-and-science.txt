Before Taking This Class...
Suggested Background Knowledge
You will be expected to come in knowing a bit of basic calculus, probability, and statistics. But do not worry too much â€“ we will provide bootcamps on that material so as to make the class pretty much self-contained. In addition, this course will involve extensive computer programming, so it would be nice to have at least a little experience in something like Excel, just to bring back the programming memories.
Technical Requirements and Software
Internet connection (DSL, LAN, or cable connection desirable)
R statistical software (free download; see cran.r-project.org)
Arena simulation software (free student download; see www.arenasimulation.com/academic/students)
Adobe Acrobat PDF reader (free download; see https://get.adobe.com/reader/)

Academic Integrity
All Georgia Tech students are expected to uphold the Georgia Tech Academic Honor Code. This course may impose additional academic integrity stipulations; consult the official course documentation for more information.
