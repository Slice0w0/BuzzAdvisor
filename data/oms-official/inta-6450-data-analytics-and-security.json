    "Suggested Background Knowledge": "This course requires no specific background knowledge. Many students with no programming background and no background in statistics have found this class approachable and learned a lot. At the same time, upper level PhD students in economics and undergrad/masters students in a range of subjects at Georgia Tech who have modest to considerable computing skills have also benefited from the wide-ranging survey of data analytic methods, the open ended project work, and the discussions around how data analytics fit into problems related to security and society.",
    "Technical Requirements and Software": "We do some exercises in R and Python. We host Jupyter notebooks for the students for Python, and we’ve had students run their own R/RStudio installations. The course project is to find “wrongdoing” among the 250k Enron emails.",
    "Academic Integrity": "All Georgia Tech students are expected to uphold theGeorgia Tech Academic Honor Code. This course may impose additional academic integrity stipulations; consult the official course documentation for more information."
