    "course-name": "cs-7650-natural-language-processing",
    "foundational": true,
    "admin": "CS",
    "Overview": "This course gives an overview of modern data-driven techniques for natural language processing. The course moves from shallow bag-of-words models to richer structural representations of how words interact to create meaning, including language models. At each level, we will discuss the salient linguistic phenomena and most successful computational models. Along the way we will cover machine learning techniques which are especially relevant to natural language processing.",
    "Course Goals": "By the end of the course students should:\n- Be able to implement a variety of commonly used algorithms for natural language text processing including statistical approaches and neural network approaches.\n- Be able to implement solutions to common natural language text processing problems including text classification, text generation, dialogue, language translation, and document retrieval.\n- Be able to analyze the statistical properties of text documents.\n- Understand the significance of different algorithms, why they were developed, and when they should be used.",
    "Suggested Background Knowledge": "\n- A course in data structures\n- A course in introductory artificial intelligence or machine learning",
    "Technical Requirements and Software": "\n- Proficiency in Python\n- Students will be advised to purchase a Google ColabÂ Pro account, though not strictly necessary.",
    "Academic Integrity": "All Georgia Tech students are expected to uphold theGeorgia Tech Academic Honor Code. This course may impose additional academic integrity stipulations; consult the official course documentation for more information."
