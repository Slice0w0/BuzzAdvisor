Before Taking This Class...
Suggested Background Knowledge
Students are expected to have an undergraduate course on the design and analysis of algorithms. In particular, they should be familiar with basic graph algorithms, including DFS, BFS, and Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm, and basic dynamic programming and divide and conquer algorithms (including solving recurrences). An undergraduate course in discrete mathematics is assumed, and students should be comfortable analyzing the asymptotic running time of algorithms.
