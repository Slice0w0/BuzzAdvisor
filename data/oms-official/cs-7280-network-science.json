    "Overview": "Network science is a relatively new discipline that investigates the topology and dynamics of such complex networks, aiming to better understand the behavior, function and properties of the underlying systems. The applications of network science cover physical, informational, biological, cognitive, and social systems. In this course, we will study algorithmic, computational, and statistical methods of network science, as well as various applications in social, communication and biological networks. A significant component of the course will focus on the overlap between machine learning and network science, covering methods for network inference, generative network models, graph embeddings using deep neural networks, and other state of the art topics.",
